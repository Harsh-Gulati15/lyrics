Peace Of Mind Lyrics
[Verse 1: KASYAP]
My heart is frozen cold
Something's up with me
I can lie, but I won't try
'Cause I'm not feeling great
I've been way to hard on myself
I've been working night and day
Just to show I'm feeling great
[Chorus: KASYAP]
I'm caught up in the race
Stuck in this mindless chase
I just need some peace of mind
But I'm caught up in the race
Stuck in this endless phase
I just need some peace of mind
Why is it so hard to find?
Caught up in the race
In the race
In the race
I'm caught up in the race
In the race
[Verse 2: Yashraj]
Samay se aage
Samay se bhage
Ghadi ke kate
Chuptе fir bhi
Sochu kaise baate
Ankhon pe pattе
Bhage chuho ki
Daud mein
Aur ye pasie
Ki jo bhasha
Bole woh hi
Toh chaud mein kyu?
Khaali dimaag hai
Shaithaan ka ghar
Par yaha
Bhare dimaag mein bhi
Soch pe sabar kaha?
Jeete darkhwaaston mein
Haafta mein
Raaston mein
Bhagta mein
Bewajah
Aur bolu khudko
''saans toh le!''

[Chorus: KASYAP]
I'm caught up in the race
Stuck in this mindless chase
I just need some peace of mind
But I'm caught up in the race
Stuck in this endless phase
I just need some peace of mind
Why is it so hard to find?
Caught up in the race
In the race
In the race
I'm caught up in the race
In the race
Why is it so hard to find?
I just need some peace of mind
Why is it so hard to find?
I just need some peace of mind
Yeah
I just need some peace of mind
Why is it so hard to find?
I just need some peace of mind
Peace of mind

Spread the Fire Lyrics
[Verse 1]
I want to call out, I want the world to know
I'm not the same but I'm not gon' lose my soul
Break out the ball and step on my own, I'm changed
Unlock the moonlight, shake off your bonds and chains
[Pre-Chorus]
When they go to look up and see
We're not gonna stop, we won't release
Walking up this road, it ain't easy
It ain't easy, it ain't easy
[Chorus]
From a flame to the blaze
We can burn out the haze
That's how we spread the fire, spread the fire
Take a light to the page
We can meltdown the pain
That's how we spread the fire, spread the fire
[Post-Chorus]
Spread the fire
[Verse 2]
Ignite the timber, let it light up the dark
Throw in your past and let out a million sparks
Built up the fever, spinning out of control
My body's shaking, I feel I'm 'bout to blow

[Pre-Chorus]
When they go to look up and see
We're not gonna stop, we won't release
Walking up this road, it ain't easy
It ain't easy, it ain't easy
[Chorus]
From a flame to the blaze
We can burn out the haze
That's how we spread the fire, spread the fire
Take a light to the page
We can meltdown the pain
That's how we spread the fire, spread the fire

Faking It Lyrics
[Verse 1]
'Cause I've been faking
Faking it for too long now
And I've been waiting
Waiting to fall in love again
To fall in love
It's complicated
(It's complicated)
This high is faded
This high is faded
[Pre-Chorus]
I know you tried but I can't feel it
Another love, that's what I'm needing now
I'm needing now
I'm alone, with you I'm depleted
I never had the love that I'm needing now
I'm needing now
[Chorus Drop]
'Cause I've been faking
'Cause I've been faking
'Cause I've been faking
[Verse 2]
I don't wanna say it, no
But I can't ignore the way this feels in my heart
And I wish that I could change it
But I can't
No

'Cause I've been faking
Faking it for too long now
And I've been waiting
Waiting to fall in love again
To fall in love
It's complicated
(It's complicated)
This high is faded
This high is faded
[Pre-Chorus]
I know you tried but I can't feel it
Another love, that's what I'm needing now
I'm needing now
I'm alone, with you I'm depleted
I never had the love that I'm needing now
I'm needing now
[Chorus Drop]
'Cause I've been faking
'Cause I've been faking
'Cause I've been faking
'Cause I've been faking
'Cause I've been faking
[Outro]
'Cause I've been faking
Faking
'Cause I've been faking
('Cause I've been faking)
('Cause I've been faking)

Noor Lyrics
Vekhan nu
Chukh charkha gali de vich paanwa
Ve loka paane main kat di
Tang teriya yaadan ne paanwa
Ve mahiya tera vekhan nu
Vekhan nu…
Tumko hai mana
Apna hi khusse zyada
Mujhko na ab tu aise
Tu, tu satana
Galti thi mana
Ab kya karoon bata na
Mujhko na ab tu aise
Tu, tu satana
Sapne jo dekhe
Dono ne milke
Un khwabon ki baaton ko
Gaatein jaunga
Vekhan nu
Chukh charkha gali de vich paanwa
Ve loka paane main kat di
Tang teriya yaadan ne paanwa
Ve mahiya tera vekhan nu
Vekhan nu, nu, nu, nu

Mirza Lyrics
[Lost Stories & JAI DHIR "Mirza" ਦੇ ਬੋਲ]
[Verse]
ਤੇਰੇ ਨਾਲ ਦੀਆਂ ਮੈਨੂੰ ਜਾਣਦੀਆਂ
ਤੇਰੇ ਮਿਰਜ਼ੇ ਨੂੰ ਪਹਿਚਾਣਦੀ ਆਂ
ਤੂੰ ਸੁਣ ਤਾਂ ਸਹੀ ਗੱਲਾਂ ਨੇ ਕਹੀਂ
ਬੇਮਾਨ ਗਈਆਂ, ਮੇਰੀ ਜਾਣ ਦੀਆਂ
ਤੈਨੂੰ ਖ਼ੁਸ਼ੀਆਂ ਮਿਲ ਜਾਣ ਗਈਆਂ
ਹਾਂ ਕਰ ਤਾਂ ਸਹੀ, ਕਿਉਂ ਮੰਨਦੀ ਨਹੀਂ?
[Chorus]
ਦੱਸਦੇ ਕੋਈ ਜੇ ਗ਼ਲਤੀ ਮੇਰੀ?
ਕੱਢ ਲੈ ਗਈ ਅੱਖਾਂ ਨਾਲ ਜਾਣ ਤੂੰ ਮੇਰੀ
ਦੱਸਦੇ ਕੋਈ ਜੇ ਗ਼ਲਤੀ ਮੇਰੀ?
ਕਰ ਦੇ ਨੀ ਹਾਂ, ਗੱਲ ਮੰਨ ਤੂੰ ਮੇਰੀ
[Instrumental]
