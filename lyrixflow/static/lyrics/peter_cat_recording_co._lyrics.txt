Memory Box Lyrics
[Verse 1]
So move over darling
If my heart bends
I'll know
And if I heard you stayed
You know I would have stayed
So baby don't hold me back
'Cause if I win
I'll change
And if I lose my way
You know I would escape
[Chorus]
Damaged by the sea
The sun blaze over me
Oh baby tie me down
I'm dangling, Oh
Past the storm
[Verse 2]
And if you change your heart
Doesn't mean I'm erased
And if I say I know
Would it be a mistake
I was once away
And now I'm just in place
And if I lose my way
I know I would be safe

[Chorus]
Damaged by the sea
The sun blaze over me
Oh baby tie me down
I'm dangling! Oh
Past the storm
[Verse 3]
Oh this is what I'll say
Just imagine I'm late
I will take my chance
And now this must end
No I won't hold you back
You're a star babe‚ go fly
And if you lose your way
You know I won't be safe
[Chorus]
Damaged by the sea
The sun blaze over me
Oh baby tie me down
I'm dangling dangling
Oh you (keep)
Dangling dangling
Oh you (keep it)
Dangling dangling
Oh you (keep me)
Dangling dangling

Floated By Lyrics
Time just floated by
Where I wanna know
Right between these eyes
Is how I wanna go
Oh something changed
I’ll deal with it
Maybe I
Was always there
All I wanna be-e-e
Is something so good
Something so good
Something so real
I know that I should
I know that I would
I was floating by
Where I wanna be
Right between these lines
Is how I wanna see
Idiots
I’ll deal with them
Maybe I
Was always there
All I wanna be-e-e
Is something so good
Something so good
Something so real
I know that I should
I know that I would
I knew that I would
I know that I should

Time just floated
Time just floated
Time just floated
Time just floated

I’m This Lyrics
Baby I just want to be free
Sometimes I don't want to believe
But oh baby baby when you cry
Oh baby baby when you cry
I don't know what it is
But I'll do anything
For you
Baby I just want you to see
Sometimes I don't want to be a part of you
But oh baby baby when you cry
Yes oh baby baby when you cry
I don't know what it is
You don't care what it is
I like
And sometimes the pain
Catches on
I worship the weight
And turn it into song
And who I am
Is not measured by
What I've become
But I know enough
I will make the same mistakes
'Cuz I don't know what it is
I don't care what it is
I'm this

Baby I think we should be freaks
Something I would never believe
But oh baby baby when you cry
Yes oh baby baby when you cry
I don't know what it is
I don't care what it is
I like
And sometimes the pain
Catches on
I worship the weight
And turn it into song
And who I am
Is not measured by
What I've become
But I know enough
I will make the same mistakes
Cos I don't know what it is
I don't care what it is
I'm this
I don't know what it is
I don't care what it is
I'm this

Heera Lyrics
This is how it ends
No money, no friends
And I just got a hard-on
(Roo, roo, roo)
(Roo, roo, roo)
I'm leaving the past
I'm giving what I can
Even though I have none
(Roo, roo, roo)
(Roo, roo, roo)
And life was so easy
Things are so clear
I don't even know anymore
(Roo, roo, roo)
(Roo, roo, roo)
I could feel the sea
Oh, I could live a lovely lie
I could live a lovely lie
I could live a lovely lie
I could live a lovely
Maybe, I'm an act
The kind who fails again
I'm ticking like a time bomb
(Roo, roo, roo)
(Roo, roo, roo)

So, give me what I need
To suffer in peace
Living on an island
(Roo, roo, roo)
(Roo, roo, roo)
And life was so easy
Things are so clear
I don't even know anymore
(Roo, roo, roo)
Maybe what I feel
(Roo, roo, roo)
Maybe, it could disappear
And I could live a lovely lie
I could live a lovely lie
I could live a lovely lie
I could live a lovely lie
But I gotta know
This is how it ends
No money, no friends
And I just got a hard-on
(Roo, roo, roo)
(Roo, roo, roo)

My world only demands
The silence of a man
Living on the sidewalk
(Roo, roo, roo)
(Roo, roo, roo)
Your life was so easy
Things are so clear
I don't even know anymore
(Roo, roo, roo)
Maybe, I should change
Maybe, I could rearrange
Oh, I could live a lovely lie
I could live a lovely lie
I could live a lovely lie
I could live a lovely lie
But, I gotta know
I would rather know

People Never Change Lyrics
[Verse 1]
People never change, but I will
'Cause I never give a fuck
That I’ll never be enough
I have washed away my sins
So I never gotta face
Consequences
Consequences
Oh
[Verse 2]
People so afraid
They're mindless
They don't wanna see you learn
They just wanna see you burn
They don’t wanna see the world turn
[Chorus]
I can walk away, spineless
Pretend it's a movie
I don't wanna face a crisis
Or something that's so real
But I don't wanna go
Just brеathe
[Verse 3]
People nеver change where I live
They just wanna see you fall
They just wanna see you crawl
I'm an enemy of violence
'Til a bullet in the heart is kindness
Let me be awake or silent
I don't wanna be a crowd
I just wanna be a cloud
And I wanna see it work out

[Chorus]
I can walk away, spineless
Pretend it’s a movie
I don’t wanna face a crisis
Or something that's too real
But I don’t wanna go
Just breathe
[Instrumental Break]
[Outro]
Baby
I was rushing away
I had reasons
I was caught in their wake
But the rain can't
Wash away my mistakes
Like the seasons
Wash away everything
I can change
Every day, I can change
I can change, change
Everything
I can change everything

Shit I’m Dreaming Lyrics
Used to think I was a man
Above these things
And all their plans
Thought I was
By the hat
Oh what they loved
I don't understand
But now I want
What I can
Shit I'm dreaming
Again
I didn't need
No house no cars
Just a little place
For my ma
A place which can touch the sea
Shit I'm dreaming
Again
I'm dreaming
Again
I've been put
In my place
Shown I'm just another
Kind of slave
Even though I sing and wave
Shit I'm dreaming
Again
I'm dreaming
Again

They all treat me
Like a dog
Like I'm just another
Cog
But they can all
Suck my cock
Shit I'm dreaming
Again
I'm dreaming
Again
Just fuck over all those fools
And you'll be winning again

Suddenly Lyrics
[Verse 1]
Suddenly, March the 13th, Papa said goodbye
He left this world and the world he loved is in Dubai
So Ma and I packed our bags and led ourselves through a door
His body flying on the aeroplane that flies us home
[Pre-Chorus]
Can we kiss you
Before the fire burns you to the bones?
I remember
You made me who I might become
[Chorus]
Oh, Papa, I know
You were fighting to live your life your way
Wherever you are
I hope you're playing
[Verse 2]
My mother knеw that she had a choice to leavе or make
Start living life or become another wasted face
She didn't know how to sign a cheque or even type
Her god is real and it guides her through her life so blind
[Pre-Chorus]
Oh, she made it
And now she's a business kind of woman
And for all these years
I couldn't tell her how proud I've become

[Chorus]
Oh, Mama, I know
You were fighting, I know you're not afraid
Is everything I am now
Worth the wait?
[Verse 3]
I'm losing you from my mind as I grow older too
Your memories are the only peace, the place I own
These songs I sing are the only way to make you listen
[Pre-Chorus]
Oh, we miss you
In everything we did and had to do
Can we hear you?
Or maybe see a sign that says hello?
[Chorus]
Oh, Papa, I know
We were drowning
But now we're on our way
[Outro]
Through everything we lost
Your ship has sailed

Soulless Friends Lyrics
Walk with me, my soulless friends
You are what I need
You've always been
Baby I know
But I won't dissolve
Something sweet
Something soft
Sometimes when I live it up
In time
What I feel, what I see
I know
That it ends
That it ends
Walk with me, my soulless friends
You are what I need, 
instruments
Maybe I know
But I don't recall
Why I'm weak, you so strong
Sometimes when I give it up
In time
What I need, I've got to hear
I know
That it ends
That it ends

Sometimes when I give it up
In time
What I need, I've got to cease
I know
I know
I know
That it ends
That it ends
That it ends

Where the Money Flows Lyrics
Maybe I could stick around
The more I would stay
The more I’d be found
Where the money goes
Where the money flows
Though I need your love
I would wiggle out
And though I feed your love
I would smuggle out
And if I make it so
And if I make it so
Baby I would burn this town
If I fall close to the edge and out
I would make it about
I would make it about
When I see the sun
I just tell a lie
Though ya pick me up and help me stay alive
Let the money flow
Where the money goes
And I see it spinning
And I see them spinning oh
And I see the world is around
Oh I see them spinning about
And I see it spinning about
Oh I see them spinning about

Baby I would burn this town
If I fall close to the edge and out
I would make it about
I would make it about
Maybe I would stick around
The more I would stay
The more I’d be found
Where the money flows
Let the money go

Portrait of a Time Lyrics
I wasn't breaking
Any rules
There just wasn't the time
Then I'd break it down
I was someone so blind
Look darling
I suggest we hurry
The stars and all the gravy
Oh baby, I know
Just let me be
That time we never wanted
Is now put into practice
Oh baby, I know
Just let me dream
Look darling I suggest we hurry
This pounding, oh so crazy
Oh baby, I know
Just let me be
Look darling
I know that you're hanging around
There's confusion
And darkening clouds
I was someone
Someone who would disagree
Now I'm here to
Ride this Lamborghini to you

I wasn't breaking
Any rules
There just wasn't the time, oh
I would break it down
I was someone so blind
Look darling I suggest we hurry
The stars and all the gravy
They're burning out and
Now they're through
That time we never wanted
Is now put into practice
Oh baby, I know
Just let me be
Look darling
I know that you're hanging around
There's confusion
And darkening clouds
I was someone
Someone who would disagree
Now I'm here to
Ride this Lamborghini
Oh I'm running ill
Somewhere else to you
Oh I'm running ill
Somewhere else to you

Look darling I suggest we hurry
The stars and all the gravy
Oh baby, I know
They're burning through
That time we never wanted
Is now put into practice
Oh baby, I know
Just let me be
Look darling
I know that you're hanging around
There's confusion
And darkening clouds
I was someone
Someone who would disagree
Now I'm here to
Ride this Lamborghini
Look darling
I know that you're hanging around
There's confusion
And darkening clouds
I was someone
Someone who would disagree
Now I'm here to
Ride this Lamborghini
To you

Foolmuse Lyrics
[Verse 1]
Could I be a muse?
Or something of use?
Oh, won't you save me?
Won't you keep me like no one you knew?
All those years
I was a glove and you knew it
Smiled when they said something stupid
If you ever want to confess
What goes on in your head
Nothing I can't guess
Nothing really new, I bet
Not trying to be a creep
Or be obtuse
But you can use me
Hit and abuse me
[Chorus]
And I'll make you happy
I'll make you so glad
That you're my baby
I want you so bad
[Verse 2]
And if you're done
Living in your house of mirrors
Oh, won't you unplug?
Sitting by my fire
You hope it
Don't seem too late
'Cause everything you love, I hate
But no matter what
It's never gonna be too late

[Chorus]
'Cause you make me happy
You make me so glad
That you're my baby
I want you so bad
Yeah, you make me happy
You make me so glad
That you're my baby
I want you so bad
[Instrumental Break]
[Verse 3]
And 'cause I'm not a fool
But something new to you
That keeps you guessing
Ain't no telling what I'd do for you
All those years, you were adrift and you knew it
Trying to sell what life ain't give yet
Next time I'm in your head
Better lie down, play dead
There's nothing left to guess
When none of you is left
Not trying to be a creep
Or be obtuse
But you can use me
Hit and abuse me

[Chorus]
And I'll make you happy
I'll make you so glad
That you're my baby
I want you so bad
Yeah, I'll make you happy
I'll make you so glad
That you're my baby
I want you so bad
[Outro]
I want you so bad
I want you so bad

Freezing Lyrics
I find disease
Pick  on someone new
I've  been here before
I've been here with you
You are someone else
Someone  I abused
That  wasn't me
That wasn't you
I  was freezing
It's sunny out there but I am freezing
It's sunny out there and June is just a gift, but I hate this
Find me another lose way
Strong  enough so I beat this
Giving a fuck isn't easy
Throwing up till I am wheezy
You'll find me on a
Broke bridge, bleeding, bruised and broken up
Indulge your hopes
Forget all I know
A party for me
On a table for two

We were somewhere else
Somewhere I consumed
Believing in me
But I'm on the moon
And I was freezing
It's sunny out there but I am freezing
It's sunny out there and June is just a gift, but I hate this
Find me another lose way
Strong enough so I beat this
Giving a fuck isn't easy
Throwing up till I am wheezy
You'll find me on a
Broke bridge, bleeding, bruiase and broken up

I Deny Me Lyrics
[Verse 1]
Somewhere deep in my mind, you appear
I could write all the poems I hear
And I'd love it if that got me by
But if I don't ever try
I'd deny me
I would love it if that got me by
And if I don't ever try
I'd deny me
[Verse 2]
Somewhere deep in my mind, you appear
As I write all the music I hear
I never wanted what I couldn't have
But if I did have a chance
I would take it
I never wanted what I couldn't have
But if I did have a chance
I would take this
[Pre-Chorus]
Somewhere I hear the silence
Somewhere undecided
Out here, as I'm designing
Something I see the light in

[Chorus]
And I'll make it so
And I'll make it snow
Yeah I'll make a home
Yeah I'll take you home
[Verse 3]
Somewhere deep in my mind, you appear
As I write all the music I hear
And I wonder what I would be like
If you were here by my side
Would I be this?
And I wonder what it could be like
If you were here by my side
Would you take it?
[Pre-Chorus]
Somewhere I hear the silence
Somewhere undecided
Out here, as I'm designing
Something I see the light in
[Chorus]
And I'll make it so
And I'll make it snow
Yeah I'll make a home
Yeah I'll make you whole

Love Demons Lyrics
While he sits and stares
At girls he can't explain
Oh, here she comes
On ten white horses
Made of string and clay
The flowers in his fingers
Wilt away
His wise old lover said
That lies do not deceive
So when she sleeps
I'll leave her bed and
Hurry home instead
My soul is on a string
Tied to her chair
And why is it I pray
To Gods that always fail
To drag that girl back
Through my window
And undress my face
And smile at me
While I put on my chains
Ah Ah Aahhh...

Flowers R. Blooming Lyrics
[Intro]
Beta
[Verse 1]
Maybe I'm a fool
A fool like you
Believing in heaven
From inside a zoo
Thinking there's a God
Laughing up above
Oh, he is a sinner
For letting us lose
[Chorus]
The flowers are blooming
The answers are looming
They will remain, and I will wait
Answers are fading
The cancers are raging
Oh, will we recover
Or will we forget
Or will we forget
[Verse 2]
Maybe we are on our way
Descending to our graves
And losing tomorrow by choosing today
Maybe thеre's a way out
A single revision
For changing is living
And living is lovе

[Chorus]
The flowers are blooming
The answers are looming
Maybe I'll recover
Oh, we will forget
Will we recover
Or will we forget
[Outro]
Yes, I'm fading
Just like a painting
We are failing
To do anything
Are we anything
Or say anything at all
Anything at all

Remain in Me Lyrics
I'll wait 'til I'm old enough to give away my mouth
She  owns without a plan to keep me safe
He  was in my blood
He was in my blood
She was in my eyes
In  the same disguise
Even  though, we'll meet
When the souls meet
I'll  remain in me
They'll remain in me
I'll wait 'til I'm old enough to give away
My father always had a plan, so I behaved
He  was in my blood
He was in my blood
She was in my eyes
In the same disguise
Even though, we'll meet
When the souls meet
I'll remain in me
They'll remain in me
And if I was gone
Then I'm lost
They'll break your heart
They'll take what's hers
And they'll never burn
They could never burn
They could never burn
They will never die
They will never die

They could never die

Copulations Lyrics
Just me
And you
Parked by the B
To copulate in ease
To copulate in ease
You know me
You know I
Can never justify
That all I have is age
That all I am is aged
So bring me that payasam
And bring me that wine
And show me that license
That lets you decide
It's all I ever mind
It's all I ever pine
The old lies
That we never threw aside
We are old lies
Man I would stay
If I can
Throw them away
Throw them away

It's all I've ever know
It's all I've ever loved
I wish you and me
Were parked by the beach
To copulate and eat
To copulate and eat
You know me you know I
Can never justify
That all I've left is age
That all I had is age
So bring me that violence
And bring me that wine
And all through this silence
The silence lets you drive
It's all I've ever minded babe
All I'll ever mind
The old lies
That we never threw aside
We are old lies
Man I would stay if I can
Throw them away
Throw them away

It's all I've ever loved
It's all I've ever loved
I wish you and me
Were parked by the beach
To copulate in ease
To copulate in ease
To copulate in ease
To copulate in ease

[Verse 1]
There were nights I would waste
So high, I could taste
Success on my lips
Now that I know
How to kiss
[Chorus]
Turn the bruises into the music
I can choose this
It's the music
Burning
[Verse 2]
Now I'm Kong in a cage
Too hard for my chains
Can I be young once again?
Now that I know
Who to blame
[Chorus]
For the bruises
It was the music
From my window
Straight
To your window burn it

[Verse 3]
Now that they dance in France
And party over you in LA
Is that enough for you
Enough for you
Maybe
In every mistake you make
Only delays, you're great
Is this enough for you, enough for you
Maybe
[Bridge]
But in the music, oh
Is when I'm perfect
And when I'm perfect, oh
Everything is, yeah
[Verse 4]
So you can dance in France
And party over you in LA
Is that enough for you, enough for you?
Maybe
And every mistake you make
Only delays, you're great
Is this enough for you, enough for you
Maybe
I turn the bruises
Into the music

Pariquel Lyrics
My girl
She ain't the best
And boy she looks pretty
Average undressed
Her eyes climb
All over mine
Tie me up slowly
And leave me to die
Oh no
Where did you go
Folded onto the floor
Sunday
We were divine
Monday
My heart was mine
I could've warned you then
She's done a hundred men
I could've warned you
But I lied
She is not yours but mine
My girl
She won't confess
But she'll be your lover
And maybe your guest
Her eyes shine
They'll drape you blind
Cut you in pieces
And rape your insides

Oh no
Where did you go
Folded onto the floor
Sunday
We were divine
Monday
My heart was mine
I could've warned you then
She's done a hundred men
I could've warned you
But I lied
She is not yours but mine
My girl
Simply so fine
Calls our conception
A glorious crime
As time flies
Faster than light
& leaves your emotions
Tied up inside
Oh no
Where did you go
Folded onto the floor
Sunday
We were divine
Monday
My heart was mine

I could've warned you then
She's done a hundred men
I could've warned you
But I lied
She is not yours but mine
Lalalalalalalala
She is not yours but mine

Clown on the 22nd Dance Floor Lyrics
Naaaaahhhh
Huh
So, I am the clown living on the 22nd floor
Got quite a wife but not one I quite adore
So I've got no money but I've got no pain
Got no loving but I ain't got no shame
And I'm just sitting here
Going insane, oh no
Oh there she goes, oh there she goes
The way she moves, the way she moves
I hope she knows, I hope she knows
I hope she'll choose
Just me, not you
So, I was a clown living on the 9th floor Got quite
A wife, but I've also been told, she's quite the whore
You know?
So I've got a silly, embarrassing stain
Comes and it goes
In the raind it stays And I'm just
Sitting here, rubbing it in vain, oh no
Oh there she goes, oh there she goes
The way she moves, the way she moves
I hope she knows, I hope she knows
I hope she'll choose
Just me not you

Lalalalalalala lalalalalala
Lalalalalalala lalalalaaaahh
So, I was the clown living on the ground floor
They call me the mother-fucking landlord
And I am the one you'd love to be
Might be the man you seem to see
Please stop - calling me a dream, oh no
[Indistinct quarrel]
Oh there she goes
Oh there she goes The way she moves, the way she moves
I hope she knows, I hope she knows
I hope she'll choose
Just me not you

A Beautiful Life Lyrics
[Verse 1]
A beautiful life lives in my mind
But we can never reach it
We're so fucking blind
Caught in these lies that we can never see it
And time after time gives me a sign
I am the only reason
[Chorus]
Maybe I could follow, maybe I could swallow
Boy, you give me life
Say you'd always be there
Lightning, thunder, makes me wonder
Boy, you give me love
Say you'll always be there
Beautiful life, livеs in my mind
If I could only seize it
[Verse 2]
A beautiful child, it's growing in sizе
Is it our only meaning?
I'm building the fire, you're cooking a tire
Pretending that we can make it
And time after time, I see the sign
I'll be the only reason

[Chorus]
Maybe I could follow, maybe I could swallow
Boy, you give me life
Say you'd always be there
Lightning, thunder, makes me wonder
Were we only high?
Say you'd always be this
Beautiful life, lives in my mind
Until the final season
[Verse 3]
Said you'd only be there
I know, sometimes
You lie, but what if I just don't care
I'm hanging by a loose thread
Say you'd always be there
Say you'd always be there
Only if you'll be there

Hail Piano Lyrics
"La La La La...
La La La La La"
"This is funny!"
"Do I sound weird?"
"What do I sound like?"
"I don't know, let's see!"
[Worship singing: "Here I Am To Worship"]
And here I am to worship
Here I am to bow down
Here I am to say that you're my God
You're altogether lovely
Altogether worthy
Altogether wonderful to me
Light of the world
You stepped down into darkness
Opened my eyes let me see
Worship
Here I am to bow down
Here I am to say that you're my God
Altogether- worship
Here I am to bow down
Here I am to say that you're my God

Something About You Lyrics
[Verse 1]
Something about you
Makes me feel so good
And living without you
Isn’t how I choose
[Refrain]
I’m nothing without you
Just another man
I’m drifting without truth
I don’t have a plan
Baby, baby be nice
Be nice
[Verse 2]
Something around you
Makes me feel so good
I'm winning around you
Even when I lose
[Refrain]
I'm nothing without you
Just another man
I’m drifting without truth
I don’t have a plan

Baby, baby be nice
Be nice
[Outro]
That’s something about me
That you cannot stand
Be nice, be nice

Black and White Lyrics
[Verse 1]
I think it's time we found ourselves again
As every little promise turns to dust
And this body needs to love
I need it
And I think
[Verse 2]
I think it's time we found ourselves again
Till every little moment seems the first
And my body needs to love
To be
Somebody
[Refrain]
In my heart it's warm
Even when you're cold
Let me wash all your wounds oh
[Chorus]
There's no black or white
Nothing's wrong or right
Let me watch
Over you
[Verse 3]
I can feel fire breathing down my neck
I remember all the lies
Oh, don't be standing bordеrline
Don't freak out cause wе've still got all the time
To be
Somebody

[Refrain]
In my heart it's warm
Even when you're cold
Let me wash over you
[Chorus]
Oh, there's no black or white
Nothing's wrong or right
While I watch
Over you
[Bridge]
Can you hear me honey?
I got a secret babe
When we're moving up
And the road is long
And we're growing old
Man
Sometimes I don't know
If I'll make it out
If I'll make it out
In my heart there's a home
[Chorus]
There's no black or white
Nothing's wrong or right
While I watch
Over you

Control Room Lyrics
[Verse 1]
I believe there is so much more to this
But I found love in a holy place
And in your heart, I already know
When you start, you're already whole
[Chorus]
In the dark, I heard you call
In the dark were chemicals
Oh, to love Is to let it go
Control
Is to let go
I just want to let you know
[Verse 2]
Here I wait
Like a dawn come crashing here
I was born as a nightingale
I was young and already yours
And the cost is heavier so
[Chorus]
In the dark, I heard you call
In the dark were chemicals
To love is to lеt it go
Control
Just to let go
I just want to let you know
I just want to let you know

Seed Lyrics
[Verse 1]
The Earth was a seed among the stars, a home
And in this dark and distant place, alone
[Chorus]
Let me take you out tonight
Let me show you that the world we had
Was such a pretty sight
We once had, we once had
[Verse 2]
It's where we played and built our graves, and watched
Caught in a fantasy, lost in the fall
But in my mind, I see a way
So come, baby
[Chorus]
Let me take you out tonight
Let me show you that the world we had
Was such a pretty sight
We once had
[Bridge]
And then we fucked it up
And we can't build another one
So now we fuck
Oh, till thе last one of us dies

[Verse 3]
The Earth a fiеld among the clouds, a home
That in a vast, infinite haste, we broke
[Chorus]
Let me take you out tonight
Let me show you that the world we had
Was such a pretty sight
We once had, we once had
[Verse 4]
No no no no no
We'll end our days with video games and ghosts
Mmm, the air was erasing me, scorching my lungs
But in my mind, I'm not afraid
So come, baby
[Chorus]
Let me take you out tonight
Let me show you that the world we had
Was such a pretty sight
We once had, had, had
[Outro]
Oh, yeah
No no no no no
And I know we'll go up in smoke
If we don't grow up at all
This I know
Oh, oh, till the last one of us dies

Happiness Lyrics
Happiness allows
Us to behave in way you'd
Only hear about
In whispers
On your radio
Happiness allows
Us to live our lives
Meaningless...
They say love is a boost
An injection
The sweetest perfume
And just as we ask
We are loveless
Your eyes
They aren't here
And I've seen them looking
Everywhere
But I know you're looking at shadows
Happiness allows
Movies in the clouds, yay
Happiness allows
Us to be Frankenstein, yay
Happiness allows
Us to live our lives
Meaningless...

And it's true, money
Can buy love
But that's all just a fancy mix-up
And I'd say love is the moment
And if it fails to be amusing
Drift down
Down to the end
There is no time
There is darkness
Happiness allows us to behave
In way you'd
Only hear about
In whispers on your radio
Happiness allows
Us to live our lives
Meaningless

We were only high in
The evening sky
Babе this is the beginning
And the fеar is gone
And the heat is on
Life will somehow be different

Just Another Love Song Lyrics
[Intro]
You
You
[Verse 1]
It's just another love song
Oh, it's just something I wrote
Something that I felt
Deep down in my soul
[Verse 2]
But it's just something I wrote
Something that I know
Something that I felt
That needed to be said
[Verse 3]
It's all I ever hoped for
Yeah, you know there's, nothing instead
But it's just something I wrote
Something that I've broke
And I needed to repair

Flies Lyrics
Don't fight
Little fly
I will surely
Hit the sky
And open the gate
Like a blind child
And I'll be home in a bit
And I will lay down
Useless flies
They're in my house
They make me lie
They make you doubt
Don't wander away
No ones right here
It's all a war
That no one notices now
Don't go
What if I don't
Love would change
I know I would
Oh home in a bit
With all my rights here
I was born
And now I'm rolling about

And if its black
And when its doubt
Lets go hard
Whatever's south
Just hold me again
Like the last time
I was sure you would wait
But I must quiet down
I'm gone, but you
Won't let me go
These bones won't tell the truth
Don't let me go

I’ve Got Roses Lyrics
You've kept me waiting
I've gotta fold it soon
You've kept me waiting
And I've got things to do
I've got these roses
All these roses for you
And now you won't move
Just a road or two
But then
We ride off
And soon
You're a star
I was waiting in that citrus town
I'm getting tired 
Of just hanging around
Lets catch some bus somewhere
And make our homes out there
But I
Never tried
'cause everyone is someone
Waiting for you
I see you're learning
All those s*****z rules
And all that money and fame
Has changed your attitude
Those girls in aftershaves
Have told you now you're safe
But I never mind
'cause after all
Whats yours is mine
I've got these roses for you
All these roses for you
And you won't move
Just a road
Or two

There Ιs Νo Love Ηere Lyrics
There ain't no love here
There ain't no love here
Love is a cage
Nobody breaks
And in a heartbeat
Only a broken sound
And I remember
Where I'd lose it all
There ain't no mother
There ain't no lover or a flame
All that I am, only a sham
I didn't notice
When I became a man
A man who always dines alone
There ain't no love here
There ain't no love here
Love is a blade
Nobody's safe
But I was a diamond
No knife could ever scratch
How I remember damaging you
There ain't no love here
There ain't no love here
There ain't no love here
No love at all

There ain't no love here
There ain't no love here
Love is a face
Made out of faeces
But I was a diamond
No knife could ever scratch
How I remember damaging you
There ain't no love here
There ain't no love here
Love is a cage nobody breaks‚ no‚ babe
I won't remember until I taste that cake
When I remember‚ I won't be long
There ain't no love here
There ain't no love here
There ain't no love here
Just the fear of dying alone

Got no loving but I ain't got no shame

I hope she knows, I hope she knows
I hope she'll choose
Just me, not you

Open your eyes
Let  me beseech
What  I have done
Let me be finally yours
And we could be funky
While  you waste
Your  months away
In a worn down stall
I  saved you last night
So open your eyes
And let me perceive
What I am now
Hold  my hand down
Lend me your heart
Let me renounce
While you waste
Your months away
Selling coffee
I saved you last night
