I Love You Baby, I Love You Doll Lyrics
[Verse 1]
Monday, come slowly, I feel a bit outta touch
With all this daily heartache, it hurts me so much
I cannot help it if I am hard to love
There's things about me that you don't know
I don't like actin' tough
You can be serious, and I can be mysterious
Share my feelings everyday, but you'll just smile at me and say
[Chorus]
I love you baby, and I love you doll
Times they get tough but my heart won't change at all
I love you baby, and I love you doll
[Verse 2]
Tuesday, come gently, I feel a little blue
I used to shine in deep bright red when I was with you
Now everything changed, only, I stayed the same
All my blue skies turned to gray, and all my flowers turned away
You can be serious, and I can be mysterious
Share your feelings everyday, but I'll just smile at you and say
[Chorus]
I love you baby, and I love you doll
Times they get tough but my heart won't change at all
I love you baby and I love you doll

[Bridge]
It's too hard to stay awake
So I'll just dream away my days
Well, I'm not the kinda guy that you fall in love with
I'm not the kinda guy that you share your heart with
I'll just smile at you and say
[Chorus]
I love you baby, and I love you doll
Times they get tough but my heart won't change at all
I love you baby, and I love you doll
Times they get tough but my heart won't change at all
I love you baby, and I love you doll
I love you baby, and I love you doll
Times they get tough but my heart won't change at all
I love you baby, and I love you doll
Times they get tough but my heart won't change at all
I love you baby, and I love you doll
[Outro]
I love you baby, and I love you doll
Times they get tough but my heart won't change at all
I love you baby, and I love you doll

Ghost Lyrics
[Verse 1]
Sometimes I get much closer than I intend
The other times I just like to sit out on the fence
Most times I can't even tell the difference
[Chorus]
I'm partially a ghost
Don't you get too close
I love you way more than you know
I'm partially a ghost
[Verse 2]
We tried to go back to the way that it was back then
It is the best thing to do when trouble ends
But then, why did the world make me what I am within?
Uh-oh, uh-oh
[Chorus]
I'm partially a ghost
Don't you get too close
I love you way more than you know
I'm partially a ghost
[Bridge]
Change my life just upon a whim
Jump into the ocean, learn to swim
Gone for summer, winter, all the seasons
I guess that might be the reason
That I am a ghost

[Chorus]
I'm partially a ghost
I love you way more than you know
That's why I'm a ghost, a ghost
[Outro]
Ghost
A ghost, a ghost
Ghost
A ghost, a ghost
Ghost
A ghost, a ghost
Ghost...

Philosophize Lyrics
[Verse 1]
Philosophize me
Tranquillize​ me
Hand in hand, we will stand
You will dream beside me
There are thoughts and
And there are worries
Sometimes it feels like my heart is in a hurry
[Verse 2]
'Cause I've got a New York state of mind
In Indian Standard Time
Sometimes it just don't seem to fit
My heart is in a mess and my soul is in a fix
It just don't fit
Philosophize your alibis and make trouble into play
Who knows? You just might believe it someday
Philosophize your alibis to make it all seem ok
'Cause we don't think, like your first kiss
Sometimes it goes away
[Verse 3]
There are thoughts and
And there are worries
Sometimes it feels like my heart is in a hurry
Generalize me
Paralyze me
Whatever you do, you cannot immobilize me

[Verse 4]
'Cause everything I say and
Everything I do
It all seems to be stuck together by some kind of super glue
I can't escape this feeling
I think I'm finally dreaming
When I go outside it's
Only into the sunshine
To make trouble into play
Who knows? You just might believe it someday
Believe it someday

Ocean Lyrics
Sail the ocean blue
I'm still in love with you
And I'd like to open my heart
I'd like for us to go to the start, yeah
There are things that I would never say or do
There are things that make me want to stick to you like glue
All we do is move
Away from memories that you wanna lose
And I'd like to change who we are
Why can't we be like movie stars?
There are things that I would never say or do
There are things that make me want to stick to you like glue
There are things that I would never say or do
There are things that make me want to stick to you like glue
And all we said before
Feelings left at the door
I come back for them later
Write it on a little piece of paper
And all I'll ever be
Is swimming at the sea
And darling why won't you be
My sweet honeybee?

Sail the ocean blue
Still in love with you
And I'd like to open my heart
I'd like for us to go to the start, yeah
There are things that I would never say or do
There are things that make me want to stick to you like glue
There are things that I would never say or do
There are things that make me want to stick to you like glue

Newbury Street Lyrics
[Verse 1]
Walking down the steps, the thought is in your head
You try to trick yourself into feeling better
Into feeling better
[Chorus]
Out on Newbury Street the sky is under your feet
We will not, we will not accept defeat
On Newbury Street
[Verse 2]
You take one step at a time and everything's alright
Your battle is your mind
The cars come rolling by, forever
Forever
[Chorus]
Out on Newbury Street the sky is under your feet
We will not, we will not accept defeat
On Newbury Street
[Bridge]
Of all the things I've done, deep inside my brain
A hundred million questions popping in and out
A big black cloud is gonna rain down on me today

[Chorus]
Out on Newbury Street the sky is under your feet
We will not, we will not accept defeat
On Newbury Street

Summer Skin Lyrics
My summer skin is growing thin
Now I need the remedy
Winter is creeping in
I can taste the gravity
When it gets cold
I need someone to comfort me
Every time I close my eyes
I can see possibilities
A different place
A different life
The dream that never sleeps
When I feel blue
I need someone to love me
Not the kind of love
That never grows
Although it seems tough
You've got to let it go
And know how to ease your soul
My summer skin is growing thin
How I need the remedy
Winter is creeping in
I can taste the gravity

When I feel blue
I need someone to comfort me
Feels like I'm ready to say goodbye
To the only love I ever had in my life
There's no Beatles song that can change my mind
Yes I'm ready to say goodbye
As I gaze up at the night sky
I ponder the momentariness of life
There's no Woody Allen film that could slow down time
Oh time
Time's a waste of life

Me & You Lyrics
[Verse 1]
Sound tunes, full of sand
Kick your shoes off and run around
Tell me all of your secrets now
You can tell me when we fall in love
[Chorus]
Just me and you
We can do all the things that you like to do
All it takes
Is just me, just me, just me... And you
[Verse 2]
Are you sorry? That we fought the other day
Are you worried? That I won't come back and say
That we're in love
In there we are, woah-oh
[Chorus]
Just me and you
We can do all the things that you like to do
All it takes
Is just me, just me, just me, me... And you
[Bridge]
Move your hands in circles
Keep me hypnotized
All of our love
It's in black and it's in white

[Chorus]
Just me and you
We can do all the things that you like to do
All it takes...
Just me and you
We can do all the things that you like to do
All it takes, yeah, all it takes
Is just me and you

Panda Lyrics
[Verse 1]
I'd love to fall in love and understand
Changing every essence of who I am
I'm not here or there
Treat my soul with care
[Chorus]
I used to be a panda in my past life
And I used to roam the forest in the nighttime
But now I'm here
Now I'm free
Now nothing's going to bother me
[Verse 2]
Take my world apart piece by piece
Put it back together, you'll have me
Stop in time with love
It's you I'm dreaming of
[Chorus]
And I used to be a panda in my past life
I used to roam the forest in the nighttime
But now I'm here
Now I'm free
Now nothing's going to bother me

[Bridge]
What if I surrender and give in?
Maybe planet Earth would win
Then I'd have to live in my own skin
What if I tie my heart to yours?
Where is the input, where is the source?
(Where is the source? Where is the source?)
[Chorus]
And I used to be a panda in my past life
I used to roam the forest in the nighttime
But now I'm here
Now I'm free
Now nothing's going to bother me

Be Something Lyrics
Sometimes I wonder
If I'm under a spell
I'm not doing well
Just haven't been myself
So I call up the doctor
But the doctor's away
There's nothing to say
It just hasn't been my day
Maybe I'll pick myself up
And I'll be okay
Get my love to stay
Won't chase her away
Wouldn't that be something?
Wouldn't that be something good?
I love to ponder
I just can't decide
There's never enough time
I'm losing my mind
We can get in the chopper
And fly up the hill
And never staying still
Never cruising downhill
When we get to the top
Oh there's a mountain to climb
We waste all our time
It wouldn't be a crime

Wouldn't that be something?
Wouldn't that be something good?
Take a little time to gauge yourself
Wear yourself
Ocean, river, mountain, cast the net
Ring the bell
I never agree with she says
I'm a dickhead
Ocean, river, mountain, cast the net
Ring the bell
Nobody else, nobody else
Sometimes I wonder
If I'm under a spell
I'm not doing well
I just haven't been myself
So I call up the doctor
But the doctor's away
There's nothing to say
It just hasn't been my day
Maybe I'll pick myself up
And I'll be okay
Get my love to stay
Won't chase her away

Wouldn't that be something?
Wouldn't that be something good?
This could be nothing
But nothing ever felt this good

Hello Lyrics
Sky above
Ground below
It's all connected but I still feel so low
On the quest
Runnin' outta time
I pass the test and now I'm just waitin' in line
When it comes
I won't say hello
I won't say hello
Pass me by
On the stairs
Turn your eyes away like you just don't care
In your heart
You know
That you just been waiting to go toe to toe
When I call
You won't say hello
No, no
You won't say hello
You won't say hello
No, no
You won't say hello

Because the moment's not right
Plus it's a waste of time
There's a mountain to climb
You see the forest for trees
Mistake the honey for bees
And when we finally meet
Yeah, when we finally meet
We won't say hello
We won't say hello
We won't say hello
We won't say hello
Please don't say hello
No, no
Please don't say hello
I won't say hello
No, no
You won't say hello
We won't say hello

WOMAN: Yeah!
ALVY SINGER: Yeah? So, so how do you account for it?
WOMAN: Uh... I'm very shallow and empty, and I have no ideas and nothing interesting to say!
MAN: And I'm exactly the same way
ALVY SINGER: I see, wow. That's very interesting, so you've managed to work out something, huh?

Secrets Lyrics
There was a frog
In a pond
He jumped from leaf to leaf
'Till dawn
And then
He closed
His eyes to sleep
There are no secrets
That he keeps
No secrets, no secrets
There was a goat
In the field
She'd munch on grass
'Till she had her fill
Dusk would fall
On her peaceful mind
She was not bothered
By speed or time
No secrets, no secrets, no secret

Drum Machine Lyrics
[Verse 1]
It's so complicated
The way that we talk all night
Then you hang up the phone
When things don't seem right
Overly outdated
The way you never stay the night
You want to keep me
But you like the fight
All this time I've waited
Trying to tell wrong from right
Keep my composure
Waiting for the green light
[Chorus]
I just want to know you number, baby
I just want to know where you live
I want to cut straight to the answer
Before I even know what the question is
[Verse 2]
Take my heart and place it
Inside a box for me
Kick drum in the basement
Perfect clarity

All my love is wasted
Inside of drum machines
Me inside the grid
And the grid in me
I just keep on racing
Trying to keep the clock in line
Fading in and out
You don't have perfect timing
[Chorus]
I just want to know you number, baby
I just want to know where you live
I want to cut straight to the answer
Before I even know what the question is
[Bridge]
It takes a machine
To reset the dream
Our love is asleep
But you'll call me later anyway
I'll follow the tide
The shore will decide
If I live or I die
Wouldn't have it any other way

We'll take a sabbatical
Wouldn't it be magical?
You're always so practical
But I don't I want you to change
[Chorus]
I just want to know you number, baby
I just want to know where you live
I want to cut straight to the answer
Before I even know what the question is
I just want to know what you've been thinking lately
I just want to know what gives
I want to cut straight to the answer
Before I even know what the question is
I just want to know you number, baby
I just want to know where you live
I want to cut straight to the answer
Before I even know what the question is

Sunbeam Lyrics
I can't really answer the phone
Honey there's nobody home
Nightfall comes with mystery
Morning brings the remedy
Evening comes and it goes
It's a condition that fosters disease
It's a formidable enemy
But it's not gonna harm me
Cause I'm a sunbeam
Looking for a settlement
A sign that tells me that it's the end
All our dreams are colonised
Every night is a separate life
Morning comes and it glows
It's a condition that fosters disease
It's a formidable enemy
But it's not gonna harm me
Cause I'm a sunbeam
Where did the sun go
Is it spinning in circles
In a universal fill
Whatever you do
Never take the blue pill

It's a condition that fosters disease
It's a formidable enemy
But it's not gonna harm me
It's a condition that fosters disease
It's a formidable enemy
But it's not gonna harm me
Cause I'm a sunbeam

Crystalline Lyrics
[Verse 1]
If the morning should slip by
I will find you in the nighttime
And if the ocean should ever run dry
I will await you on the shoreline
[Pre-Chorus]
If this moment could be mine
I would seize it just in time
The stars will not align
This must be real apple shine
[Chorus]
Because it's crystalline (Because it's crystalline)
Always on my mind (Always on my mind)
Mind, always on my mind
[Verse 2]
If your regulations do not comply
I will enable you to do the climb
And if you should feel uneasy at any time
I'll be the one to push you over that line
Yes, I will
[Pre-Chorus]
If this moment could be mine
I would seize it just in time
The stars will not align
This must be real apple shine

[Chorus]
Because it's crystalline (Because it's crystalline)
Always on my mind (Always on my mind)
[Bridge]
Forget the ocean, forget the sea
Forget the story of you and me
The world is big and it's on TV
You cannot construct a canopy
Of the things you love to hide inside
Trees are big but the sky is wide
Wide enough to swallow you hole
You'll never really be in control
No, no no
[Chorus]
Because you're crystalline (Because it's crystalline)
And always on my mind (Always on my mind)
This love is crystalline ('Cause it's like a liked crystalline)
And always on my mind

Surgeon Lyrics
Everything's in perfect balance
Nothing that I say is challenged
I am a neurosurgeon
I may be the only person
Who sees through the trap of reason
I am a neurosurgeon
Myriad of time and feeling
Tower of discovery leaning
Human is best when he's dreaming
Not when the sun is beating
Boson is kicking and screaming
Life doesn't really need a meaning
Everything's in perfect balance
Nothing that I say is challenged
I am a neurosurgeon
I may be the only person
Who sees through the trap of reason
I am a neurosurgeon
I'm always on the edge of life
Not dying anymore
I'm always on the edge of time
Not counting anymore
I can stop and change my mind
No more dreaming at the door
I'm always on the edge of life
Not dying anymore

Everything's in perfect balance
Nothing that I say is challenged
I am a neurosurgeon
I may be the only person
Who sees through the trap of reason
I am a neurosurgeon
Often times I get the feeling
That our lives are short and fleeting
And every single day I'm leaving
This bed of love and meaning
Evidence of a higher ceiling
Universe is all preceding
I'm always on the edge of life
Not dying anymore
I'm always on the edge of time
Not counting anymore
I can stop and change my mind
No more dreaming at the door
I'm always on the edge of life
Not dying anymore

Down At the Sky Lyrics
Where did your love go?
Did you leave it at the store
When you were there before?
I think you should know
This is who we are
Grossly under par
All my life I've been living a lie
Time to look down
At the sky
Keep your heart and head low
Aerial surprise
Can deconstruct your life
I used to be a good soul
Decided who I am
Before I drew a plan
All my life I’ve been living a lie
Time to look down
At the sky
If you never want me to let go
You need introspection
If you don't want all our friends to know
There's always deception
The universe will always grow
Into newer tensions
I will take my final form
I’ll make my decisions

All my life I've been living a lie
Time to look down
At the sky

Bedouin Lyrics
[Verse 1]
Who's the person that corrects you
When your diction comes out wrong
Your vowels sound too long
Your words just rush along
As your hero to the rescue
When you're drifting from your mark
Your bite just has no bark
You're losing that old spark
[PreChorus]
Oh god, not again
I thought I was independent
But I'm just another descendent
Yeah, I'm just another descendent
[Verse 2]
Who's the person that reflects you
When you're flying at your best
Bright glowing from your chest
You feel better than the rest
As your best friend that protects you
When thе decade goes too fast
You'rе always coming last
There's no future in the past

[PreChorus]
Oh god, not again
I thought I was independent
But I'm just another descendent
Yeah, I'm just another descendent
[Chorus]
Please don't let me know
If you want me home again
I'm happy as a bedouin
Living as I float
Through a chain of incidence
Stories of no consequence
But there's no place to go
And i'll just change my destination
Journey to a revelation
[Bridge]
Who's that great connector
Between the real world and your dreams
Telling the bird from the bees
Blessing you every sneeze?
[PreChorus]
Oh god, not again
I thought I was independent
But I'm just another descendent
Trying to find my way to heaven (ooh)

I tried to be a friend
But friendship is overrated
Yeah, I'm just another descendent
I'm just another descendent
[Chorus x2]
Please don't let me know
If you want me home again
I'm happy as a bedouin
Living as i float
Through a chain of incidence
Stories of no consequence
There's no place to go
I'll just change my destination
Journey to a revelation
[Outro]
And please don't let me know
If you want me home again
I'm happy, happy

Monkey Lyrics
I won't be there, I won't be fine
I'll let you in to the corner of my mind
I'll build you up then I'll break you down again
Have you tried green tea on vanilla swirls?
Yes we all live in experiment world
Well I don't think I'd have it any other way
What about climbing that tree?
What about seeing the world in your dreams?
What about the monkey inside of me?
I've been there time and time again
I tried so hard to just be your friend
I don't think that we're looking at it in the right way
You build these walls all around yourself
Then you try to be somebody else
The fruit that you love begins to lose its taste
What about climbing that tree?
What about seeing the world in your dreams?
What about the monkey inside of me?
Cosmically speaking, I think I'd be dreaming
If I fell in love
Over and in and under and out
I think it's each other we found
I could be anyone anywhere anytime
Only if I made up my mind
Well I was the monkey and you were the monkey
Only if we let each other be
I could be anyone anywhere anytime
Only if I made up my mind

What about climbing that tree?
What about seeing the world in your dreams?
What about the monkey inside of me?
They are the first and last things you see
They are from space and they don't want to leave
They're always there

Evening Sun Lyrics
Carolina, do you have it all?
Things you want and more
Like insomnia
Do you feel it in your bones?
Are you trying to let it go?
It's not the secrets that you keep
Water doesn't run too deep
In the morning you'll finally sleep
Where you learn to let it be
I should have told you
I won't be back tonight
I'll be out there chasing lights
Paranoia, does it get in your way?
Waking you for days
It's not the secrets that you keep
Evening sun brings no heat
In the morning you'll finally sleep
It's not the secrets that you keep
Water doesn't run too deep
In the morning you'll finally sleep
It's not the secrets that you keep
Evening sun brings no heat
In the morning you'll finally sleep
When you learn to let it be

Sleepyhead Lyrics
[Verse 1]
It's cloudy in the morning
Atmospheric warning
I feel alive when I'm at rest
The citizen is walking
The meadowlark is talking
Chances taken, nothing else
[Pre-Chorus]
Opportunities, they slip
I see a sinkin' ship
Time is such a difficult test
[Chorus]
Well maybe this is what I get
For bein' such a sleepyhead
Never finishin' my quest
'Cause I like dreamin' best
I can't wait for what comes next
[Verse 2]
Let me tell you things about this
The hero and the prophet
Travelling only for the day
The mountains may be mеlting
And I'm afraid of flying
But the moon still shines on evеry lake

[Pre-Chorus]
Temporary breakthrough
Bound to disappoint you
Oh, I could never take a break
[Chorus]
Well maybe this is what I get
For bein' such a sleepyhead
Never finishin' my quest
'Cause I like dreamin' best
I can't wait for what comes next
[Bridge]
Ooh, but we promise that we have bright ideas
We're playin' small clubs but we want the arenas
A studio production that needs no introduction
The road ahead is long but it's clear
[Breakdown]
Maybe this is what get
For bein' such a sleepyhead
Never finishin' my quest
'Cause I like dreamin' best

Well maybe this is what get
For bein' such a sleepyhead
Never finishin' my quest

To keep me alive
Was I built
Or was I born
Is it a natural
Or electrical storm
Don't let me go
I won't survive
Without your love
To keep me alive

One Hundred Shadows Lyrics
I tunneled to the centre of the earth
To escape the troubled surface world
What did I find
What did I learn
The stars in the sky, they began to turn
And all the demons knew my name
All the answers were the same
The sun is split into equal parts of ten
My head turned round and round again
Did I receive or did I send
A river of faith into the world of men
Kings and queens, they knew my name
All the questions were the same
One hundred shadows, filled the atmosphere
One hundred shadows, tried to pull me near
I tunneled to the centre of the earth
To escape the troubled surface world
What did I find
What did I learn
The stars in the sky, they began to turn
And all the demons knew my name
All the questions were the same
Kings and queens, they knew my name
All the answers were the same

The Nightingale Lyrics
[Verse 1]
I am a king
Losing my grip on proceedings
You came to win
Following all of you feelings
[Chorus]
Destiny unveiled and unmade
The nightingale
Upon my shoulder blade
Again, again and again
Again, again
[Verse 2]
Taking it all in
Careless and often misleading
Learning to swim
Deep in the pools of Darjeeling
[Chorus]
Destiny unveiled and unmade
The nightingale
Upon my shoulder blade
Again, again and again
Again, again

[Instrumental Break]
[Chorus]
Destiny unveiled and unmade
The nightingale
Upon my shoulder blade
Again, again and again
Again, again and again
