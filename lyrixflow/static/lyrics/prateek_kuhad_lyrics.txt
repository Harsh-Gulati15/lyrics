Saansein Lyrics
Saansein meri ab befikar hain
Dil mein base kaise yeh pal hain
Baatein sambhal jaa rahi hain
Palkon mein yoon hi hansi hai
Man mein chhupi kaisi yeh dhun hai
Har khaahishein uljhi kidhar hain
Pairon se zakhmi jameen hai
Nazrein bhi thehri hui hain
Hai ruki har ghadi
Hum hain chalein raahein yahin
Yeh manzilein humse khafa thi
In par chayi oss si bewafa thi
Baahon mein ab khoyi hain raatein
Haathon mein khuli hain yeh shaamein
Yeh subha hai nayi
Hum hain chalein raahein yahin
Main apne hi mann ka hausla hoon
Hai soya jahan par main jaga hoon
Main peeli sehar ka nasha hoon
Main madhosh tha ab main yahan hoon
Saansein meri ab befikar hain
Dil mein base kaise yeh pal hain
Naghmein khile hain ab saare
Pairon tale hain mashalein
Thamm gayi hai zameen
Hum hain chalein raahein yahin

Main apne hi mann ka hausla hoon
Hai soya jahan par main jaga hoon

Co2 Lyrics
[Verse 1]
Maybe I was wrong and you were right
But I don't really wanna have this fight
I just wanna feel like I belong
And every time my heart swings back to you
You are my morning and my truth
And all that I can do is sing this song
It ain't that long, hm
[Chorus]
And nothing says "I love you" like your eyes
Fill my lips with carbon dioxide
I just wanna feel like I deserve you
'Cause you deserve me
Baby, it's the way that you can see
What I miss and what I can never be
I just wanna feel like I deserve you
'Cause you deserve me
[Verse 2]
Maybe you were wrong and I was right
I don't care, won't you stay another night?
I just need some time to be myself
I couldn't say "I need you" on that night
When you left and I lost all track of time
I just want you close so I can feel you
Can you feel me? Mm

[Chorus]
And nothing says "I love you" like the words
That were never said, but could be heard
If only there was peace around us, baby
You would hear me
And maybe it's the way that lovers do
I just want for me what I want for you
Only with the sun above us maybe
You would see me
[Post-Chorus]
Mm, mm, mm
[Bridge]
And even if you leave, I may be fine
'Cause my heart, it has its own design
And even if you never see it, baby
You're all that I need
[Chorus]
Maybe it's the silence in your eyes
Maybe it's the lilac when you're shy
Maybe it's the mystery of your love
All I need is a sign from the stars above
Maybe it's the way that you breathe in me
Maybe it's the man that you see in me
Maybe it's the fragrance of your hair
Yeah, I just wanna kiss you when you're there

[Outro]
I just want you all around me, baby
Can we make that happen, please?

Kadam Lyrics
Main kadam kadam
Badalta hoon yanhi
Ye zindgi baldalti hi nahi
Hai lafzon ki kami
Main idhar udhar fisalta hi raha
Ye man kabhi sambhalta hi nahi
Hoon yaadon mein chupa
Ye shaam kaise rang si hai
Uddti utarati patang si hai
Main kal ki raahon mein hoon pasaa
Ye waqt bhi mujhe bhulaa gaya
Main ghadi ghadi bekhabar hi tha
Kya raaj mere dil mein hai chupaa
Hai naam kya mera?
Kyun? sawalon ki lahar mujhe mili
Main ghul gay samya ki aag thi
Ye nazmein bhi ghul gaye
Ye raastein kyun alag se hain
Likhate tahalte kalam se hain
Main kal ki saanson mein hoon chupa
Ye waqt bhi mujhe bhulaa gaya

Ye shaam kaise rang si hai
Uddti utarati patang si hai
Main kal ki raahon mein hoon pasaa
Ye waqt bhi mujhe bhulaa..
Ye raastein kyun alag se hain
Likhate tahalte kalam se hain
Main kal ki saanson mein hoon chupa
Ye waqt bhi mujhe bhulaa gaya
Ye waqt bhi mujhe bhulaa gaya!

Tune Kaha Lyrics
[Verse 1]
तेरे हवाले है, ये ज़िंदगी मेरी
तेरे उजाले से सब राहे हैं यहा
अपने नसीब का मैं बादशाह नहीं
तु मेरी शाम हैं, तु ही मेरी सुबह
[Chorus]
तुने कहा, मैंने सुन लिया
तुने कहा, मैंने सुन लिया
तुने कहा, मैंने सुन लिया
तुने कहा, मैंने सुन लिया
[Verse 2]
शोर आया ऐसे तो, तु बेफिक्र हैं क्यूं
शरमाई मंजिले, तु बेख़बर है क्यूं
रंगो से दोस्ती है मैंने भी करी
क्या है तु सोचती, मुझको भी तो बता
[Chorus]
तुने कहा, मैंने सुन लिया
तुने कहा, मैंने सुन लिया
तुने कहा, मैंने सुन लिया
तुने कहा, मैंने सुन लिया
[Bridge]
फिकर के दिन, और रातें
ढल गया सूरज कहाँ
फिजूल की थी बातें
खो गए थे हम जाने कहाँ

[Chorus]
तुने कहा, मैंने सुन लिया
तुने कहा, मैंने सुन लिया
[Verse 3]
रोज़ाना मेरी तो हैं दास्तां नई
पुर्जे पूराने हैं, पर शौक है कई
तारो की रोशनी ने दिखाया रास्ता
पर मैं मुकर गया, तु साथ जो यहीं
[Chorus]
तुने कहा, मैंने सुन लिया
तुने कहा, मैंने सुन लिया
तुने कहा, मैंने सुन लिया
तुने कहा, मैंने सुन लिया

Tum Jab Pass Lyrics
[Verse 1]
कितने वादें, कितनी बातें बाक़ी हैं
कितने दिन और कितनी रातें बाक़ी हैं
इन परछाइयों से बदल भी जाऊँ तो
मैं बेफ़िकर हूँ, मदहोश हो भी जाऊँ तो
[Chorus]
तुम जब पास आती हो
पलकों से मुस्कुराती हो
हवाएँ भी गुनगुनाती हैं
तुम जब पास आती हो
[Verse 2]
उलझी नज़रें कैसे अंजान शहरों में?
सारी क़समें बहती यादों की लहरों में
इस गहराई से बेख़बर हो जाऊँ तो
मैं बेफ़िकर हूँ, मदहोश हो भी जाऊँ तो
[Chorus]
तुम जब पास आती हो
पलकों से मुस्कुराती हो
हवाएँ भी गुनगुनाती हैं
तुम जब पास आती हो
[Verse 3]
खो जाने की ज़िद ना करो
ख्वाहिश है ये दिल की
राहों को नज़र में रखो

[Bridge]
मैं भी तो लौट आऊँगा
हवाओं सा गुनगुनाऊँगा
[Pre-Chorus]
कितने वादें, कितनी बातें बाक़ी हैं
कितने दिन और कितनी रातें बाक़ी हैं
[Chorus]
तुम जब पास आती हो
पलकों से मुस्कुराती हो
हवाएँ भी गुनगुनाती हैं
तुम जब पास आती हो
[Outro]
तुम जब पास आती हो
तुम जब पास आती हो
तुम जब पास आती हो

100 words Lyrics
[Verse 1]
Five am trains
And broken chains
I called you every afternoon
Forrest Gump
And the hurricane trails
Though we never followed through
[Chorus]
Do you have a 100 words for me?
'Cause I have only three
And you couldn’t even sing for me
And I keep on writing these songs
Over and over
And I keep getting closer to you
[Verse 2]
A lover’s home
Is never shown
It’s never known, to the common folk
You called me over
Said my name three times over
But you never looked me in the eyes
[Chorus]
Do you have a 100 words for me?
'Cause I have only three
And you couldn’t even sing for me
And I keep on writing these songs
Over and over
And I keep getting closer, to you

[Chorus]
Do you have a 100 words for me?
'Cause I have only three
And you couldn’t even sing for me
And I keep on writing these songs
Over and over
And I keep getting closer, to you
And I keep on writing these songs
Over and over
As I keep getting older, with you

Pause Lyrics
Prateek Kuhad returns with “Pause”, a wistful examination of modern relationships. The music video exhibits how relationships can be precarious, as Dhruv and Kavya try navigating theirs.
[Verse 1]
I can never speak in tunes before
But for you, I could write a symphony
If only you would sing alone
Doesn't even need to be in key
Is what I have enough for you?
Or do you need all the things that I don’t?
Separate all the lies from the truth
Picking up the pieces so
[Chorus 1]
Can we hide?
I need you close
Can we pause this moment
Keep it open, close?
Dance alone
And this time we'll split our hearts wide open
[Verse 2]
Yes, everything, it changes
But we still feel the sameness
Slip away as we fade away
Can you make me feel that you will never leave?
Will it ever be the same again?

We hold each other just to, stay in place
Maybe I'll just be the one to say
[Chorus 2]
Can we hide?
I need you close
Can we pause this moment
Keep it open, close?
Dance alone
And in time we’ll split our hearts wide open
Love, hold me close
Can we pause this moment
Keep it open?
No, Can we go home?
And this time we'll keep our hearts wide open

​cold/mess - Audiotree Live Version Lyrics
[Verse 1]
When I feel cold
I’ll keep you close
And if I could hold you
And take you home
[Verse 2]
When at night
Your toes touch mine
I’ll sing you to sleep
If you were mine to keep
[Chorus]
I wish I could leave you my love
But my heart, is a mess
My days they begin with your name
And nights end with your breath
With your breath
[Verse 3]
To sway just like
It was Friday night
And all the lights
Will blind me dry
[Verse 4]
My lullaby
Is your sigh
And I can feel it
When you cry

[Chorus]
I wish I could leave you my love
But my heart is a mess
My days they begin with your name
And nights end with your breath
[Chorus]
I wish I could leave you my love
But my heart is a mess
My days they begin with your name
And nights end with your breath
With your breath
[Bridge]
When I feel cold
I keep you close
And if I could hold you
And take you home
And if I could hold you
And take you home

Mulaqat Lyrics
[Chorus]
ये कैसी मुलाकात है
जैसे सदियों से तुम मेरी जान हो
अब कैसे मैं ये समझाऊँ
कितने अरसों से तुम्हारा ही मुझे
इंतज़ार है
[Hook]
हो हो हो हो हो
हो हो हो हो हो
हो हो हो हो हो
हो हो हो हो हो
[Verse 1]
तुम जो पास आई
चूमने का यूँ बहाना लेके
तब से तुम मेरी हो दास्तान
चाँद को बुलाकर
तुमने चमकाई मेरी जो रातें
तब से मैं तुम्हारा ही हुआ
दोनों ही कलाईयों पे
चांदी है सजी
होठों पे जो लाली है
दिल में बस गई
ये मिलन कैसी आग है
जल जाने की ही आस है
मदहोशी हो या ना भी हो
इस प्यार की गहराई का कोई
इंतेहां नहीं

[Hook]
हो हो हो हो हो
हो हो हो हो हो
[Verse 2]
नाचने का मन करे तो
झूम लेंगे हम
और सितारों के बगीचे
घूम लेंगे हम
थोड़ी सी मज़ाकिया भी
बातें हम करेंगे
मिल गया है आशियाँ
हम आँखों से कहेंगे
यूँ होता है प्यार क्यों
थोड़ा डर भी है
थोड़ा जुनून
है गवाह महफ़िल की बेताबी
जाने कैसे कोई कह सके कि यह
इत्तेफाक है
[Hook]
हो हो हो हो हो
हो हो हो हो हो
[Chorus]
ये कैसी मुलाकात है
जैसे सदियों से तुम मेरी जान हो
अब कैसे मैं ये समझाऊँ
कितने अरसों से तुम्हारा ही मुझे
इंतज़ार है

[Outro]
हो हो हो हो हो
ये कैसी मुलाकात है
हो हो हो हो हो
ये कैसी मुलाकात है
हो हो हो हो हो
ये कैसी मुलाकात है
हो हो हो हो हो
ये कैसी मुलाकात है

Yeh Pal Lyrics
लबों पे जो भी हो
कह भी दो ठहर हूँ मैं
ये दिल की बात को रोको न ठहर हूँ मैं
नशीली रात है, तारे भी साथ है
गुनगुनाते हम चले शहरों की गलियों से
जाने क्यूँ ये पल पिगल गया, फ़िसल गया
जाने क्यूँ ये पल पिगल गया, पिगल गया
ये कोई न कहे, सुने भी कोई न ये
इरादे वो ही है, बदल गई मंज़िल
ये कैसा खेल है, क्यूँ इधर हम फस गए
ये वादों का है क्या, आज है, कल नहीं
जाने क्यूँ ये पल पिगल गया, फ़िसल गया
जाने क्यूँ ये पल पिगल गया, पिगल गया
तू भी है, मैं भी हूँ
प्यार भी है यहाँ
नज़र में तू आ गई
नज़र में मैं आ गया
है रास्ते जुदा, तो क्या हुआ राज़ी हूँ मैं
जज़्बातों का है क्या, आज है, कल नहीं
लबों पे जो भी हो
कह भी दो ठहर हूँ मैं
ये दिल की बात को रोको न ठहर हूँ मैं
जाने क्यूँ ये पल पिगल गया, फ़िसल गया
जाने क्यूँ ये पल पिगल गया, पिगल गया
पिगल गया, पिगल गया
पिगल गया, पिगल गया

Drown Lyrics
[Verse 1]
And all of my heart is broken
But the salt of my wounds
Will never follow you around
I won't ever make a sound
Taking every step in fear
If only you could hold me close
This time, I think I'm bound to stay alone
[Verse 2]
And last night was the first time
We inched close to cyanide
Our blood red as beetroots
And I can show you
The skies, they felt orange
They held me in solace
Just whisper my name
I'll never let you go
[Chorus]
Baby, can you hold me close, please?
Tell me all your stories so I can sleep in peace
Baby, can you whisper my name?
I could never swim in sorrows
But tomorrow always follows
So I'll tie up my lips for you, babe
Silently, we break our keys, see?
Can we open doors?
Shyly find me, wine me kindly
Kiss me as I drown
As I drown, as I drown
As I drown, as I drown
As I drown, as I drown
As I drown, as I drown

[Chorus]
And if only your love could hold me
If your arms would just enfold me
I would tie up my lungs for you, babe
As I drown, as I drown
As I drown, as I drown
As I drown, as I drown
As I drown, as I drown

​fighter Lyrics
And I have been fighting for you
Open wounds and loose smiles, for you
I could have been another friend
Or I could pretend
Could you open your doors?
Can we climb out your windows?
Or would you fall with me love
When you find me within you?
It's red as wine, I'll shine, you'll see
It's open and close
I'm fine, believe me
These cold and empty skies, you'll see
My fingers will hold your hand, believe me
I have been fighting for you
Open wounds and loose smiles, for you
I could have been another friend
Or I could pretend
Could you open your doors
Can we climb out your windows
Or would you fall with me love
When you find me within you
When you find me within you
When you find me within you
When you find me within you

It's red as wine, I'll shine, you'll see
It's open and close, I'm fine, believe me

Oh Love Lyrics
Don't worry bout me
I've got another hour
Or so to kill
Don't worry bout me
I'll find another place to begin
It's over done
Have faith, have faith
Patience my love
To know the truth
The rest is yet to come
Oh it's time
Oh love, be mine
No, go slow
So high, so low
Don't worry bout me
I'll fake another trick
To grab her in
Don't worry bout me
I've got a million tricks up my sleeve
You'll never know
How near, how far can this go
So don't you fret
My dear, by now
You should know
Oh it's time
Oh love, be mine
Behold these eyes
Oh love it's time
Behold these eyes
There's a fire that burns
Inside my soul
You'll feel another side
Of you tonight
For another time
Oh it's time
To make up your mind
Don't waste time
Oh love be mine

​with you/for you Lyrics
Yeah you seem to be okay
Your sweet taste in my mouth stays
So I’ll be waiting in the corner
For you
Not mindless, I’m just spineless
Put Cellophane on my mouth and kiss
My love is lying in the corner
For you, you
It’s true, true
We grow old with these folds of time
Mold each other into perfect wine
I bless the day that our heartbeats lined
My love is lying in the corner
For you, you
It’s true, true
For you, you
It’s true, true
I sing this broken tune
But is it for you
As we sleep we’re growing older

I wait here for you
You wait for the truth
Everyday is getting longer
Yeah, I know that it’s no secret
With intensity, we split sticks
It's slowly dying in the corner
With you, you
It’s true, true
With you, you
It’s true, true
With you, you
It’s true, true

Dard nahi toh, sard hai tere bin
Kyun hai khafa yun, tu hi toh hai manzil
Kaisi ibadat, pairon siyaahi hai
Mere kalam ki tu hi kahaani hai
In khwahishon me khoya hua hoon
In zakhm khaatir meri sunoh

Tere hi hum hain
Kya yeh

Ye zulfon ka andhera jo chha gaya

Tu roshni, tu saaz hai

Tera guroor maaf hai

Aur raat raazi hai
Abhi to sham baki hai

Cold Shoulders Lyrics
We crossed our desires, we crossed our eyes
In tokens, in charms, in smoke, in kind
We spent it all
We buried our cause
We straightened our spine
Swayed and fettered, swooned and crowned
Even the bliss is pain somehow
I read up on glances and tethered to chances
Eloped with the sounds
How did you perceive me
How did you complete me
Cold shoulders apart
Sway into my arms
Slip into my heart
I stumbled with grace in my stride
I cordoned my hopes to one side
I slipped on my swerves
I balanced on curves
I slowed down my ride
Oh when you were faded, you looked away
When you were spoken, when you refrained
I called in my favours
I called in my troops
I left you alone

Tired of being only
The rain, the sun, the lonely
Cold shoulders apart
Sway into my arms
Slip into my heart

​for your time Lyrics
[Verse 1]
We didn't lie together
With our tired limbs and bones
In exile together
Find a way to come back home
I did pause, I did stay
I did fall, I did care
[Chorus 1]
And so I beg you
So I beg you
So I beg you
So I beg you
For your time
For your time
For your time
For your time
And you hold my silence in your truth
And you hold my silence in your truth
[Verse 2]
Every waking tower
Every empty broken rule
Could grow old desire
In your full sleeves
And my torn shoes
I was young
I was taken
And in time, forsaken

[Chorus 2]
And so I beg you
So I beg you
So I beg you
So I beg you
To be mine

And your touch, was all that was felt
But we fell apart, take me back to the start
But we fell apart, take me back to the start

When you took my heart
When you took my heart
When you took my heart

Just a Word Lyrics
[Verse 1]
Am I the one that you want?
Maybe it's time to let me know
Picking me up from the floor
Maybe it's time to let me go
[Pre-Chorus]
Did you see me and feel me?
Did your body deceive me?
Can you heal me
Before our lips entwine?
Can this be painless?
And blameless with all our insaneness
Our grip tightens, we fight it from inside, mhm
[Chorus]
Yeah, it was just a word, but we never let it hurt us
Tryna find a world where this love really dеserves us
Yeah, baby, I am waiting if you lеt me know, yeah
It was just word, but we never let it hurt us
[Verse 2]
Just one of those times
We couldn't let our feelings show
Need you from nine to nine
I want you more than you could know

[Pre-Chorus]
Did you see me and feel me?
Did your body deceive me?
Can you heal me
Before our lips entwine?
Can this be painless?
And blameless with all our insaneness
Our grip tightens, we fight it from inside, mhm
[Chorus]
Yeah, it was just a word, but we never let it hurt us
Tryna find a world where this love really deserves us
Yeah, baby, I am waiting if you let me know, yeah
It was just word, but we never let it hurt us
[Bridge]
Mhm, yeah, we never let it hurt us, oh
[Chorus]
Mhm, yeah, it was just word, but we never let it hurt us
Tryna find a world where this love really deserves us
Yeah, baby, I am waiting, if you let me know, yeah
It was just word, but we never let it hurt us

[Verse 1]
हाँ, मैं गुमसुम हूँ इन राहों की तरह
तेरे ख्वाबों में, तेरी ख्वाहिशों में छुपा
ना जाने क्यों, है रोज़ का सिलसिला
तू रूह की है दास्तान
[Chorus]
तेरे ज़ुल्फ़ों की ये नमी
तेरी आँखों का ये नशा
यहाँ खो भी जाऊँ तो मैं
क्या कसूर है मेरा?
[Verse 2]
क्यों ये अफ़साने इन लम्हों में खो गए
हम घायल थे इन लफ़्ज़ों में खो गए
थे हम अनजाने, अब दिल में तुम हो छुपे
हम हैं सेहर की परछाइयाँ
[Chorus]
तेरे साँसों की रात है
तेरे होंठों की है सुबह
यहाँ खो भी जाऊँ तो मैं
क्या कसूर है मेरा?
क्या कसूर है मेरा?

तेरे झुलफ़ों की ये नमी
तेरी आँखों का ये नशा
यहाँ खो भी जाऊँ तो मैं
क्या कसूर है मेरा?
तेरे साँसों की रात है
तेरे होंठों की है सुबह
यहाँ खो भी जाऊँ तो मैं
क्या कसूर है मेरा?
क्या कसूर है मेरा?
क्या कसूर है मेरा?

[Verse 1]
When I feel cold
I’ll keep you close
And if I could hold you
And take you home
[Verse 2]
When at night
Your toes touch mine
I’ll sing you to sleep
If you were mine to keep
[Chorus]
I wish I could leave you my love
But my heart is a mess
My days, they begin with your name
And nights end with your breath
I wish I could leave you my love
But my heart is a mess
My days, they begin with your name
And nights end with your breath
With your breath
[Verse 3]
To sway just like
It was Friday night
And all the lights
Will blind me dry
And my lullaby
Is your sigh
And I can feel it
When you cry

[Chorus]
I wish I could leave you my love
But my heart is a mess
My days, they begin with your name
And nights end with your breath
I wish I could leave you my love
But my heart is a mess
My days, they begin with your name
And nights end with your breath
With your breath
[Instrumental]
[Chorus]
I wish I could leave you my love
But my heart is a mess
My days, they begin with your name
And nights end with your breath
I wish I could leave you my love
But my heart is a mess
My days, they begin with your name
And nights end with your breath
With your breath
[Outro]
When I feel cold
I'll keep you close
And if I could hold you
And take you home
And if I could hold you
And take you home

Hopelessly Lyrics
[Verse 1]
Yeah nothing felt safer
So silently we fall
I wrote it on paper
Cause it’s all I’ve really got
[Chorus]
You, you have me hopelessly in love
You, you have me hopelessly in love
[Verse 2]
I wanna believe you
But the pain comes in the way
I don’t wanna leave you
But all the signs they point away
[Chorus]
You, you have me hopelessly in love
You, you have me hopelessly in love
[Bridge]
Believe me, you complete me
Feel me, can you heal me?
I need you close
I need to belong
I feel so confined
I won’t carry on
We sleep under stars
Embrace on our knees
Look into my heart
I need you to see

[Outro]
I wanna believe you
But pain comes in the way
I don’t wanna leave you
But darling I need to walk away
You, you have me hopelessly
You, you have me hopelessly in love

Go Lyrics
[Verse 1]
Don't leave me hanging sideways
We are drunk and driving highways
And our bodies are inclined
To escape the morning light you
Bring your hopes up with the sunrise
But our hearts lie someplace else
[Pre-Chorus]
We are hidden behind these window sills
We are hidden behind these sheets that never end
[Chorus]
If you go, I won't even know now
If you leave, I won't even show it now
If you go, I won't even know now
If you leave, I won't even show it now
[Verse 2]
I did try to be your lover
It was beautiful under covers
And our bodies were inclined
We are wasted in our youth and
We are spent and we are clueless
Did we question our souls?

[Pre-Chorus]
We are hidden behind these window sills
We are hidden behind these sheets that never end
[Chorus]
If you go, I won't even know now
If you leave, I won't even show it now
If you go, I won't even know now
If you leave, I won't even show it now
[Outro]
I won't even frown

Ab Hoga Kya Lyrics
Hazaaron ishaare karoon bhi to kya hai
Paheli, paheli, paheli, paheli hai woh
Hazaaron ishaare karoon bhi to kya hai
Paheli, Paheli, Paheli, Paheli hai woh
Aayi hai kahaan se
Jaayegi kahaan ye koi na jaane

Dil mein mere ab hoga kya
Josh kaisa hai ye mann main mere

Gehri hai kahaani nayi hai
Anokhi nishaani hai ye

Rog kaisa hai ye
Har saans mein
Dil mein mere ab hoga kya
Josh kaisa hai ye

Darling Darling (Live at Island City Studio) Lyrics
[Intro]
Hmm-mmm-mmm
Hmm-mmm-mmm
[Verse 1]
Remember you said that you'd love me till death?
I've got it all but I don’t have you
Then, someone told me my mind is a mess
That someone was you, you know it too
[Refrain]
Hmm-mmm-mmm
Hmm-mmm-mmm
[Verse 2]
And then we slipped and our hearts, they stood still
Yeah, I'll fight it all, I know that I will
Maybe in time, I'll show it to you
Yeah, I'll make it right, I'll make it true
[Chorus]
Darling darling, hmm-mmm-mmm
It’s just morning, hmm-mmm-mmm
[Verse 3]
So baby, hold me close
And feel me with your toes
Your lips an overdose
Yeah, I said goodbye I know

[Verse 4]
Love is a conqueror, love is a friend
She bites really hard, that’s all I can tell
Everyone falls and I know we will too
With love in our eyes, it's all we can do
[Chorus]
Darling darling, don’t let me go
It’s just morning, kiss me some more
So, darling darling, don’t let me go
Yeah, it’s just morning, kiss me some more
Darling darling, don’t let me go
It’s just morning, kiss me some more
Kiss me some more, kiss me some more
Hmm-mmm-mmm

I’m Someone New Lyrics
[Verse 1]
I don't know why but I can only smile for you
I'm so disarmed that I lose track of time with you
Living inside of a world that's just made for us
Sometimes you whisper to me but it's never enough
Tell me
[Chorus]
What did you do?
Isn't it true?
I'm someone new
When I'm with you
Say it again
Soft like your hands
Sweeter than honey
When do we land?
[Verse 2]
Now I'm awake and I'm not tryna run away
Seen everything through your eyes and I wanna stay
Something about you just lingers in all my dreams
Leaving behind all the things that now don't have a place for me
[Chorus]
What did you do?
Isn't it true?
I'm someone new
When I'm with you
Say it again
Soft like your hands
Sweeter than honey
When do we land?

[Bridge]
Then comes the night, there's a silence around me
Fall into dimensions where fear just surrounds me
And everything burns, does everyone fade for you?
Deep inside of me, something's falling apart
I don't care wherever you are
I just want you to stay, I want you to stay, do you?
[Outro]
What did you do?
I'm someone new
And what did you do?
Darling, it's true
I'm someone new
When I'm with you

All I Need Lyrics
[Verse 1]
Would you break away
If I tied my heartstrings to you, baby?
And every day
I wanna see your perfect body right beside me, baby
[Chorus]
I want you to know that I did try
To open your heart and break in inside
I want you to know that I believe
I'd heal all your wounds and take all your tears
'Cause, baby, you're all I need
[Verse 2]
Do you believe?
I wanna love you like the storm that lives inside me, baby
Pull me deep in your sea
I wanna swim through your veins
I wanna move through you, baby
[Chorus]
I want you to know that I did try
To open your heart and break in inside
I want you to know that I believe
I'd heal all your wounds and take all your tears
'Cause, baby, you're all I need

[Post-Chorus]
Baby, you're all I need
Yeah, baby, you're all I need
[Chorus]
I want you to know that I did try
To open your heart and break in inside
I want you to know that I believe
I'd heal all your wounds and take all your tears
'Cause, baby, you're all I need

Baby, you're all I need
Baby, you're all I need
Baby, you're all I need
And I could be all you need

Flames Lyrics
Cold feet were a trademark with you
And all the old games we played
And all the flames that did fade
Truth be told, all our dreams are sold
And all the foul play we hate
And all the flames that did fade
So true to my game
I did hope it would change
For my pride is you
My only find is you
And all my time is you
Before i try to bleed
Before my soul does sleep
I’m overwhelmed with you
My only find is you
And all my time is you
So true to my game
I did hope it would change
For my pride is you
My only find is you
And all my time is you

Just to Be With You Lyrics
So, Why did you take my heart away
This love, just winter ahead
And even the chain couldn't keep but still
This love, maybe it will
This night will swallow our sin's
What i wouldn't do just to be with you
What i wouldn't do just to be with you
What i wouldn't do just to be with you
What i wouldn't do just to be with you
What i wouldn't do just to be with you

Into the Night Lyrics
[Verse 1]
When I was young, I could tell between the moon and the stars
And I would hold my breath underwater for a minute and a half
You came along, to be my baby
And then you came along, to be my darlin'
[Verse 2]
Love, when did I learn to be perfectly fine
With the wind in my hair and the cold of my feet was gone? Then you came along to be my baby, love
Then you came along to be my darling
[Chorus]
It was love before I even held your hands
It was love and I could tell that I was weak in the knees
And so we danced our time away into the night
[Verse 3]
I thought I was born in a jungle but I was born
In a palace of green and I couldn’t stay
Another night without holding my knees between yours
Another night without feeling your lips on mine
[Verse 4]
Baby if they call me a failure, you could be my prize
If my life is a joke, you could be my smile
Another home, another land, another city
If it means that I could be a better man in your eyes

[Chorus]
It was love before I even held your hands
It was love and I could tell that I was weak in the knees
And so we danced our time away into the night
[Chorus]
It was love before I even held your hands
It was love and I could tell that I was weak in the knees
And so we danced our time away into the night
[Outro]
It was love, before I even closed my eyes
It was love and I could tell that you were holding your breath
And so we sang our hearts out into the night
Out into the night, out into the night

Just Like A Movie Lyrics
[Verse 1]
Feels like I've been drivin' in the dark
Countin' every car, thinkin' of you
I've been walkin' circles in my room
Nowhere to move, waitin' for you
And if you could just say the word
I won't be hurt, I won't be hurt
[Pre-Chorus]
And all I know is
[Chorus]
You're dressed like the movies
An eighties somethin' vibe
And no one knows what you're hidin', baby
But I just think I might
With every conversation
You're pullin' at my heart
Just like a movie
The end is where we start
[Post-Chorus]
Start
Start
Start

[Verse 2]
Wish that I was livin' in your dream
Swimmin' in the sea of nothin' but you
If only you were thinkin' it too
Comе close to me and I'll make it truе
And if you could just say the word
We'll take the turn, we'll take the turn
[Pre-Chorus]
But all I know is
[Chorus]
You're dressed like the movies
An eighties somethin' vibe
And no one knows what you're hidin', baby
But I just think I might
With every conversation
You're pullin' at my heart
Just like a movie
The end is where we start
[Post-Chorus]
Start (Where we start)
Start (Where we start)
Start (Where we start)
The end is where we start

[Bridge]
If you know what you want
Can you let me in your heart?
In your heart
The end is where we

You're dressed like the movies
An eighties somethin' vibe
And no one knows what you're hidin', baby
But I just think I might
With every conversation
You're pullin' at my heart

The end is where we start

Kuch Din Lyrics
[Verse]
Essi ek yaad thi, paas mein baithke
Tumne sikhaya kaise mohabbat karo
Chaadar main yuhi, haath ko thaamke
Tumne bataya ankhon mein kaise rahe
[Chorus]
Kuch din hi bache hain
Jab tak dil bhre hain
Baahon mein raho tum
Dhadkan meri dhun hai
Tan pe jo sihayi
Dil mein yu milaadi
Baahon mein raho tum
Dhadkan meri dhun hai
[Verse]
Zulfon ki oed mein, essa jod hai
Kaise main batayu kya raaz ho tum
Shabnam hai jaisi saanson mein nami
Behja'oon mein ho essi awaaz tum

Kuch din hi bache hain
Jab tak dil bhre hain
Baahon mein raho tum
Dhadkan meri dhun hai
Tan pe jo sihayi
Dil mein yu milaadi
Baahon mein raho tum
Dhadkan meri dhun hai

Kyu hai faasle? kya nazar mein ikraar kaafi nahi?

Essi ek yaad thi, paas mein baithke
Tumne sikhaya kaise mohabbat karo

Kuch din hi bache hain
Jab tak dil bhrе hain
Baahon mein raho tum
Dhadkan meri dhun hai
Tan pe jo sihayi
Dil mеin yu milaadi
Baahon mein raho tum
Dhadkan meri dhun hai

Lilac Skies (Live at Island City Studio) Lyrics

Can I fill my pockets with your dreams?
Show you everything you’ve never seen
I beg you darling, hold me please
[Chorus]
And we'll lie, under lilac skies
We'll combine

Baby, can I love you every day?
Every time I hold you, don't sway
I wait in the corner every day

And we'll lie, under lilac skies
We'll combine

You make me feel this rush of blood, with your touch
Can I forget those days and lose myself, in your arms?
You make me feel this rush of blood
You make me feel this rush of blood
You make me feel this rush of blood, with your touch
Can I forget those days and lose myself, in your arms?
You make me feel this rush of blood, with your touch
Can I forget those days and lose myself?

And we'll lie, we'll combine

The Last Time Lyrics
[Verse 1]
The last time I had you
How did I find you?
Nosebleeds
 and sunscreen
Yeah, my heart screams "I want you"
The lines blur in your fake fur
Yeah, your shiny, fake skin purse
Hold me and I'll hold you
When you're with me, I'm with you
[Chorus]
I don't wanna hide away
Baby, can you let me be someone again?
Don't wanna hang sideways
Baby, can you let me be someone again?
Did I even know you?
Did you even know me?
Let's rewind
[Verse 2]
Baby, you're a safe space sometimes
Or maybe we just needеd some time
When you kiss mе, yeah, my lips hurt
When you touch me, my skin burns
Hm, baby, hold me through the night

[Chorus]
I don't wanna hide away
Baby, can you let me be someone again?
Don't wanna hang sideways
Baby, can you let me be someone again?
Did I even know you?
Did you even know me?
Let's rewind
[Bridge]
Our heartbeats lined, we're one design
Our heartbeats lined, we're one design
Our heartbeats lined, we're one design
Our heartbeats lined, we're one design
[Outrod]
Baby, you're a safe space sometimes
Baby, you're a safe space sometimes
Or maybe we just needed some time

Artist Lyrics
She thinks of herself
As an artist
She walks to the show
Like a queen
Her demeanour is slick
And she can turn you down with a flick of her fingers
If she feels it
She thinks of herself
As a lady
She walks by the aisle
With grace
Her hair flows down her neck
And she might even give you a peck on your lips
If she feels it
She thinks of herself
As an artist
Ooooh, she’s an artist

Favorite Peeps Lyrics
[Verse 1]
I slept with my toes between all my sheets
It feels like I never could truly keep up
With all of my hands and all of my feet
I need all the warmth I can get from my
Favorite peeps, I keep them around
I have to stay strong, but I wanna give up
[Verse 2]
My fire is strong, but sometimes I leap
Into the pits of imaginary slumps
With my new kicks that I never picked
I need all the heart I can get from my
Favorite loves, I need them with me
I should stay strong, but I wanna give up
[Bridge]
It's just love, lust, then lonely, no time to be alone
Don't know what I have, but I want what I don't
May slip, slit my wrist with a call on my phone
Don't know what I need, what I have, I don't see
They said, "give time" (Time)
(Timе) Time
(Time) time
[Verse 3]
Thеy take me around, they tuck me to sleep
They keep me in check when I wanna break in
To my own self, within my debris
I need all the hugs I can get from my
Favorite bugs, they need me too
I need to stay strong, so I don't let them know

[Outro]
Patience is fatal, but pain is not weak
Patience is fatal, but pain is not weak

I know feelings when I see them in a room
Yeah, they just need me and you
I keep waiting for you even when you tell me I'm a loon
[Chorus]
Don't you see? Time and time, I fail
And lately, I've been talking to myself again
[Verse 2]
A bit too much, but it isn't fair
'Cause I don't have your eyes to stare into
I dare you to compare your embrace to anywhere
I still need you, I don't care
[Chorus]
Don't you know? I've been on my own far too long
If you're on your way, I'll stick around
[Verse 3]
I couldn't sleep and now I can
I still need to feel your touch and hold your hands
Yeah, I want you all around me
I keep it in, but I write it down

Don't you know I've been on my own far too long?
If you're on your way I'll stick around

Be at Ease Lyrics
I'm glaring wildly at traces of love
Staring blankly at signs from above
Breathe under the sun, living without kin or kith
We are all looking for someone to be at ease with
And wined and dined, a trollop at nine
Believe it or not, she’s doing fine
Often, everything that we know turns out a myth
We are all looking for someone to be at ease with
Ease, to be at ease
To be at ease
To be at ease
A drop of luck, a pinch of fate
Lift your heart, it’s never too late
Sow your blood, reap your flesh, hold steady your scythe
We are all looking for someone to be at ease
And we are all looking for someone to be at peace

Holding On Lyrics
It was shown and behold her hair was golden
Her eyes were blue, as the sea was bold
And free
Her eyes were bold and free
We grew with the town, we laughed and we frowned
Our eyes withdrawn, but our hearts were bold
And free
Our hearts were bold and free
We walked with our shadows behind us and close
We danced with our bodies with me
Holding on to you
And you holding on to me
We painted the sky, with blues of a thousand kinds
We were fools, for the moon was ahead all this while
The moon was ahead all the time
So broken and done, our souls and our bones
May be old and sore, but our eyes they shone like the sun
Our eyes they shone like the sun
We walked with our shadows behind us and close
We danced with our bodies with me
Holding on to you
And you holding on to me

O Piya Lyrics
Tumne mann ko yu chhua
Jaane kaise yeh hua
Aankhon hi hi aankhon se
Kaise tumne yeh kaha
Ab darwaazo pe jo khushboo ho tum
Shor-aawaazon mein kyun goonje ye dhun
Maine pyaar, tum se kiya
Par main keh na saka, o piya
Paani hai mera jiya
Behta ruk jaaye kyun dil mera
Khojta kyun faasle
Dil mera toh saaf hai
So jaao is chhaaon mein
Saaya tumse aaj hai
In jazbaton se main kaise ladu?
Yeh mujhse hi hain khafa
Maine pyaar, tum se kiya
Par main keh na saka, o piya
Paani hai mera jiya
Behta ruk jaaye kyun dil mera

Kyu tum naaraaz ho
Mere khwaabon mein toh tum hi ho
Mujhko aawaaz do
Main tumhara hoke na bhi hoon
Mujhse pyaar, tum ne kiya
Par main seh na saka o piya
Paani hai mera jiya
Bеhta ruk jaaye kyun dil mera
Humne pyaar hai kiya
Tum maano bhi na toh maanе jiya

Kudrat ka yhi hai silaa, toota toh dil tera mera
Janeman sochke mujhe tu yeh bta
[Verse]
Teri rooh tabeez mein
Mere glle pe noor hai
Bechaeniya manzoor hai
Tu paas hoke kyun door hai?
Kitne haseen raaton se bna yeh silsilaa
[Chorus]
Janeman sochke mujhe tu yeh bta
Tere bin aasra mera kya hai khuda?
Kudrat ka yhi hai silaa, toota toh dil tera mera
Janeman sochke mujhe tu yeh bta
[Verse]
Saaya tera tha dhoop mein
Tu hai sitaara har roop mein
Kabhi rooth jaye toh tujhe saath lelunga
Aur dekhte hi dekhte apna bna lunga
Mehfooz karliya tha hamne saara hi jahaan

[Chorus]
Janeman sochke mujhe tu yeh bta
Tere bin aasra mera kya hai khuda?
Kudrat ka yhi hai silaa, toota toh dil tera mera
Janeman sochke mujhe tu yeh bta

Fire Lyrics
Oh, would you call me a liar
If I told you my love, had no end
Oh, would you call me a liar
If I told you my love, had no beginning
No one was hiding
What we were trying to find
Was always there
We were just not aware
We were folding our jeans
To step into the salty sea
Let the sand stick to our toes
Until we fall asleep
Oh, would you call me a liar
Oh, would you call me a liar
Oh, would you call me a liar
Oh, would you call me a liar
Oh, can you hold my fire, for me

Khone Do Lyrics
[Verse 1]
Lafzon Ke Najakat To Dekho
Adaon Ke Shararat To Dekho
Khoya Main Khoyi Ho Tum
Mere Mann Ki Har Chahat Ho Tum
[Chorus]
Baahon Mein Baahon Mein Khone Do
Is Pal Ki Aadat Hai Hone Do
Baahon Mein Baahon Mein Khone Do
Is Pal Ki Aadat Hai Hone Do
[Verse 2]
Tere Dil Ki Ye Sajish Hai
Kya Nazar Ki Izazat Hai
Ruki Hui Hai Har Ghadi
Tere Aankhon Ke Dhun Mein Chhupi
[Chorus]
Baahon Mein Baahon Mein Khone Do
Is Pal Ki Aadat Hai Hone Do
Baahon Mein Baahon Mein Khone Do
Is Pal Ki Aadat Hai Hone Do
[Verse 3]
Kisi Kal Ki Adhoori Kahani
Kisi Roj Ka Maamla
Kahan Hoon Main Kahan Ho Tum
In Saanson Ki Chadar Mein Gum

[Chorus]
Baahon Mein Baahon Mein Khone Do
Is Pal Ki Aadat Hai Hone Do
Baahon Mein Baahon Mein Khone Do
Is Pal Ki Aadat Hai Hone Do
Baahon Mein Baahon Mein Khone Do
Is Pal Ki Aadat Hai Hone Do

Held You Tight Lyrics
I hold my breath and
Slow my heart beat when
You console me
Babe you showed me the light
When I’m lonely
When I’m over the edge
Babe you fool me
Babe you showed me the light
I have held you tight
Could not open my eyes
I have held you tight
Could not open my eyes
I pride myself in
Knowing you so well
But you know me
Babe you showed me the light
In my heartache
In my lonesome time
Babe you found me
Babe you showed me the light
I have held you tight
Could not open my eyes
I have held you tight
Could not open my eyes

So let's start over
I’ll pour my heart out to you
Oh I’m clueless
Babe you showed me the light
So we saunter
Through a thousand suns
We’ll just wander
Babe you showed me the light
I have held you tight
Could not open my eyes
I have held you tight
Could not open my eyes

Chahe Ya Na Chahe Lyrics
Tere sapno ke baadal pe
Sundar sama hai mehfil jawan
Hawaaon ne cheekha hai shaamil bhi shaam
Mukaddar Sikandar ka bhi maan'na hai
Ke mera chhota sa ghar hai yahaan
Tu chahe ya na chahe jaan
Jo parde uthe tu kahan main yahin hu
Main karvate badalta hu sota nahin hu
Tu sapno ki raani main raaton ka raaja
Tu bholi kahaani, main aandhi ka waada
Hai kiski ye marzi ye kisne likha
Tu chahe ya na chahe jaan
Tu chahe ya na chahe jaan
Tu chaahe ya na chaahe jaan
Aaja samaa mein taare na dekhe
Honsh udaane waale raahein na milein
Rakth hi rahe laal siyaahi ki cheethi
Bheege kagaz ka adhura soona fasana
Hai laal, neeli, peeli ye mann ki tarangein
Sab hanste hai mujhpe
Phir jalte sabhi hain
Hawaaon ne cheekha hai shaamil bhi shaam
Mukaddar Sikandar ka bhi maan'na hai
Ke mera chhota sa ghar hai yahaan
Tu chaahe ya na chaahe jaan
Tu chaahe ya na chaahe jaan
Tu chaahe ya na chaahe jaan

Jaane kahaan hai voh

Mere iraade kaun badalta hai
Mere khayalon ko, banaye jo
Jaane kahaan hai voh
Jaane kahaan hai voh
Tere hone se hai jahaan
Gune rangeen aasman
Tera suraj, tera chaand
Kya pata
Mere khwabon ko, banaye jo
Meri hakikat ko, sajaye jo
Jaane kahaan hai voh
Jaane kahaan hai voh
Tere hone se hai jahaan
Gune rangeen aasman
Tera suraj, tera chaand

Tere hone se hai jahaan
Gune rangeen aasman

Heartbroken Lyrics
[Verse 1]
Yeah, I've been heartbroken
I felt it fill my lungs in
My breath is heavy with you
And all my nights are soaked in
[Refrain]
Your touch
It's a crutch
Just this once
Let it burn
[Verse 2]
Sing this, baby, dance with me
This song is all that hides in me
Like a slingshot splits me in two
Strong as dusky whiskey in you
[Refrain]
This love hurts
Let it burst
Just slay me
Just taste me
[Bridge]
I glance with sunlight this limelight
You fortified me with your eyes
Like wine, my hands fly your body tonight
So stay, please, by my side

[Verse 3]
Let this be the last time
Let your hands stay in mine
I won't sleep or let you
Until your lips slide in minе
[Refrain]
My love
Can we burn?
Just this once
Can wе burn?
Just this once
Can we burn?

Full Time Lover Lyrics
And now I don't have any time for anything at all
'Cause I'm so busy falling in love with you
No, I don't need no days off
And no happy hour at five o'clock
All I wanna do is fall in love
'Cause falling in love with you
Is my full-time occupation
I'll love you till the end of time
I'll love you even if you leave me behind
It feels that good, falling in love with you
And I'm so lucky that you love me too

No Complaints Lyrics
[Verse 1]
We have another evening free
Let's settle on a fantasy
We have everything we need in this room
Scented candles and a little bit of destiny
Just tryna to tell me
That maybe I should try to be someone new
[Chorus]
And you look so good, baby
With your hair flowing
But I'd rather know what's on your mind
I'm tryna make sense of finally facing
Every embrace and your love
Just keeps on taking over my life
I'm not complaining but I
[Verse 2]
Need a couple of hours to breathe
Find something to hold on to
I know you don't have faith in me but I do
I have intеnsity too
[Chorus]
And you look so good, baby
With your hair flowing
But I'd rather know what's on your mind
I'm tryna make sensе of finally facing
Every embrace and your
Love just keeps on taking over my life
I'm not complaining but

[Bridge]
Should we close our eyes and maybe think about it?
Not tonight though
I don't care what tomorrow holds for us
I know I won't let go
I don't have every answer, babe
I just want you to know
That I will fall for you every time
[Chorus]
And you look so good, baby
With your hair flowing
But I'd rather know what's on your mind
I'm tryna make sense of finally facing
Every embrace and your
Love just keeps on taking over my life
I'm not complaining but I
[Outro]
I'm not complaining but I
I'm not complaining at all

Hollow Lyrics
[Intro]
Who did you find? Who did you follow?
I wake up late, I wake up hollow
Who did you find? Who did you follow?
I wake up late, I wake up hollow
[Verse 1]
I closed my eyes, I let the fire burn
I meant to stay, I meant to call her
[Refrain]
We said goodbye, we made it harder
We said we'll fight, we made it harder
[Verse 2]
We opened our eyes and it was cold out
We kept our needs, we kept our ghosts out
I wept the night, I wept my heart out
I felt my skin roll up and roll down
[Refrain]
We said goodbye, we madе it harder
We said we’ll fight, wе made it harder
[Instrumental Break]

[Refrain]
We said goodbye, we made it harder
We said we'll fight, we made it harder

Who did you find? Who did you follow?
I stayed up late, I waited for you
Who did you find? Who did you follow?
I stayed up late, I waited for you

A Shot of Alcohol Lyrics
I'm, a shot of alcohol for you
The scary monster in your dreams
A cigarette lighter when you're blue
I'm the broken guitar you threw away
The pretty song you never made
I'm the last step of your 
ruse
Your eyes in mine, by the fire under the moonlight
I have tried, to stare back into your reflection
I thought you'd never say goodbye
That you'd be with me when I cry
But I'm just another one of your
Free times, free times

Face Lyrics
[Verse 1]
Time is just a place that we never wanna disgrace
I just wanna face the world with my shut eyes
I thought this could be the one time that I escape
But nothing really seems to change with the sunrise
[Chorus]
I felt always like a fool, if only I could lose me
Leave me clueless in my shoes so nothing can confuse me
All I needed was a touch of sazeracs that choose me
Leave me naked in my clothes with the folks that always usе me
[Verse 2]
But maybe this is just a game and I nеver knew how to play it
I just wanna face it all with my shut eyes now
Maybe I try my luck and take a peek
All I wanna see is miles of blue skies now
[Chorus]
I stay in just to contain the thoughts that do consume me
I just wanted to stay sane, why do I think I'm vain please
All I needed was the love of sazeracs to snooze me
Leave me naked to my soul and him and me will soon sleep
[Verse 3]
Stripped down to my glass nerves, they crack in a split
So I can see my blood move as it slips right out
I could sing this once, twice, thrice, and again, but maybe
This can only end with my knees and my tongue tied down

[Chorus]
I thought this would be the one time that I escape
I just wanna face the world with my shut eyes
I just wanna face the world with my shut eyes
I just wanna face the world with my shut eyes
I just wanna face the world with my shut eyes
I just wanna face the world with my shut eyes
I just wanna face the world with my shut eyes
I just wanna face the world with my shut eyes
I just wanna face the world with my shut eyes
I just wanna face the world with my shut eyes

Drown (Live at Island City Studio) Lyrics
[Verse 1]
And all of my heart is broken but the salt of my wounds
Will never follow you around, I won't ever make a sound
And taking every step in fear, if only you could hold me close
This time I think I'm bound to stay alone
[Verse 2]
And last night was the first time, we inched close to cyanide
Our blood red as beetroots, and I can show you
The skies they felt orange, they held me in solace
Just whisper my name, I'll never let you go
[Verse 3]
Baby, can you hold me close, please
And tell me all your stories, so I can sleep in peace?
Baby, can you whisper my name?
I could never swim in sorrows, but tomorrow always follows
So, I'll tie up my lips for you, babe
[Verse 4]
Silently we break our keys, see
Can we open doors?
Shyly find me, wind me, kindly
Kiss me as I drown
[Refrain]
As I drown, as I drown, as I drown, as I drown
As I drown, as I drown, as I drown, as I drown

[Instrumental]
[Verse 5]
And if only your love could hold me
If your arms would just enfold me
I would tie up my lungs for you, babe
[Refrain]
As I drown, as I drown, as I drown, as I drown
As I drown, as I drown, as I drown, as I drown

Something Wrong Lyrics
There is something wrong
There is something wrong with the way I think
Everybody say
Everybody tells me not to be this way
Take another look
Think about it differently today
Take another shot
You'll have another shot at it someday
Its spilling through my life
Spreading through my mind
And I can’t escape
This flood in my mind
Sometimes it feels all right
Somedays it feels all right to see the light
I'm living a hundred lives
But I wanna live just one, just right
But nobody knows
Nobody understands what's on my mind
The light that I can see
The world where I believe in me

Its spilling through my life
Spreading through my mind
And I can’t escape
This flood in my mind
Its spilling through my life
Spreading through my mind
And I can't escape
This flood in my mind
There is nothing wrong
There is nothing wrong with the way I think
There is nothing wrong
There is nothing wrong

Hum Dono Lyrics
Mera sahara
Roshni ho tum
Adhoori si dhun hi sahi
Mujhe gaakar sunao na
Chehra tumhaara
Aur tumhaari hasi
Kamzor ho jaata hu
Mere man ko sambhalon na
Ab din tere toh meri ratein hai
Meri chandni kyun dur ho
Tum mujhse, sooni baahein hai
Meri shaayari, ho sirf tum
Koshish toh maine poori thi kari
Phir kyun
Hum dono ke hi dil
Kin kono mein ja chhupe hai
Kismet me the jo din
Unhe bhool na jaana tum
Yaadein hai sheeshon si
Gir kar bikhar jaayengi
Tasveerey kho jaaye toh
Mujhe bhool na jana tum

Woh silvatein joh
Chaadaron me thi tum
Mere dil se khelo nahi
Mujhe baahon mein ab lelo na
Ab din tere toh meri ratein hai
Meri chandni kyun dur ho
Tum mujhse, sooni baahein hai
Meri shaayari, ho sirf tum
In raahon pe hum, gum gaye hai kyun?
Aur ho sake toh tum
Mera naam likh lena
Kisi kore kagaz pe
Usse saath rakh lena
Mera muskarana yaad rakh lena, tum
Hum dono ke hi dil
Kin kono mein ja chhupe hai
Kismet me the jo din
Unhe bhool na jaana tum
Yaadein hai sheeshon si
Gir kar bikhar jaayengi
Tasveerey kho jaaye toh
Mujhe bhool na jana tum

Big Suprise Lyrics
This house, it breathes tonight
We are, the blood and veins, we took the reins
For now, the time has come
It's not a big surprise
We fought, in many wars
We proved our love, we proved our faith
For now, it's gone, I know it's wrong
It's not a big surprise
So sleep
Sleep tight, tonight
You know
Tomorrow will be bright
I know it's cold
My hands are warm
My heart is strong
It's not a big surprise
There are a thousand dreams
That lie within the sheets, in old LPs
For now, they lie asleep
It's not a big surprise

We smoke our breath away, this foggy night
Foresight is not on our side
It's not the pain, that's on my mind
It's just the big surprise
So sleep
Sleep tight, tonight
You know
Tomorrow will be bright
I know it's cold
My hands are warm
My heart is strong
It's not a big surprise
It's not a big surprise
It's not a big surprise
It's not a big surprise

Rubber Bits Lyrics
Rubber bits on the floor, no more
I'm a 100 days, away, from home
But I know that it's not the same
Cause rubber bits on the floor
Rubber bits on the floor, no more
Cold and wet noses
Silent fits and poses
The mice are on the floor
But rubber bits no more, mm hmm
Like a lazy Monday
Slipping through the doors
The mice are on the floor
But rubber bits no more mmhmm
Cold and wet noses
Silent fits and poses
The mice are on the floor
But rubber bits no more, mm hmm
Still there are times, in my eyes, tears
Waking up to the wet, morning shadows
Cold and wet noses
Silent fits and poses
The mice are on the floor
But rubber bits no more, mhm

Yeah you seem to be okay
Your sweet taste is my mouth stays
So I’ll be waiting in the corner
For you
Mind less, I’m just spineless
Put Cellophane on my mouth and kiss
Love is lying in the corner
For you, you
It’s true, true
Grow old with these folds of time
Mold each other into perfect wine
Bless the day that our heartbeats line
Love is lying in the corner
For you, you
It’s true, true
For you, you
It’s true, true
I sing this broken tune
Is it for you
As we see we’re growing older
I’ll wait here for you
You wait for the truth
Everyday is getting longer

Yeah I know that it’s no secret
With intensity, we split sticks
Slowly dying in the corner
With you, you
It’s true, true
With you, you
It’s true, true
With you, you
It’s true, true

​for your time - Audiotree Live Version Lyrics
We didn't lie together
With our tired limbs and bones
In exile together
Find a way to come back home
I did pause, I did stay
I did fall, I did care
And so I beg you
So I beg you
So I beg you
So I beg you
For your time
For your time
For your time
For your time
And you hold my silence in your truth
And you hold my silence in your truth
Every waking tower
Every empty broken rule
Could grow old desire
In your full sleeves
And my torn shoes
I was young
I was taken
And in time, forsaken

And so I beg you
So I beg you
So I beg you
So I beg you
To be mine
