Khoj (Passing By) Lyrics
[Verse 1]
You were the one that I found
சொல்ல வந்தா சொல்லிட்டே போ
Why didn't you tell me enough?
சொல்ல வந்தா சொல்லிட்டே போ
I ponder in closure, remember
The world that is out there for me to find
[Chorus]
Let me go passing by
Let me go come back in time
Let me be who I am
All through this time
Let me go passing by
Let me go come back in time
Walk in the dark
Barefoot in the night
[Verse 2]
Walking down the way that I found
இந்த உலகம் நான் சுத்த வேண்டும்
Faces with smiles all around
இந்த வானம் நான் பார்க்க வேண்டும்
I’ll run free into the sea
The world and me
I don't even know what I will find

[Chorus]
Let me go passing by
Let me go come back in time
Let me be who I am
All through this time
Let me go passing by
Let me go come back in time
Walk in the dark
Barefoot in the night
[Outro]
दिल मेरा खोया यहाँ
दिल मेरा सोया वहाँ
दिल मेरा खोया यहाँ
दिल मेरा सोया वहाँ

When We Feel Young Lyrics
[Verse 1]
I found you passing by in cold December
Lost in view, but still your face and your gaze I remember
Looking at the diamonds in your eyes
Shine in the pale moonlight
We've come so far
Looking up above to the sky
Everything just seems so fine
This is our time
[Chorus]
Into the night
I feel alive
At 59
When we feel young
[Verse 2]
I found us
Reminiscing our days together
Found our names
Written in the stars forever
Looking back at all that we've been through
A fairy tail come true
I'm there for you
Looking up above into the sky
Everything just seems so fine
This is our time

[Chorus]
Into the night
I feel alive
At 59
When we feel young
Into the night
I feel alive
This is the time
When we feel young
[Outro: All]
बारिशों में भीगे हुए हम
झूमे-नाचे यहाँ
ख्वाहिशें मेरी पूरी हुई अब
ये अपनी दास्तां
बारिशों में भीगे हुए हम
झूमे-नाचे यहाँ
ख्वाहिशें मेरी पूरी हुई अब
ये अपनी दास्तां

Kahaani Lyrics
[Intro]
काश कभी तुम समझोगी
कि क्यूँ हम करीब नहीं
काश कभी तुम जानोगी
कि अब तक है तेरी कमी
[Verse 1]
पता है हमें कि तेरे बिना
अधूरी है ये ज़िंदगी
पता है हमें कि मेरी फ़िक्र
अब तक तुम्हें है कहीं
[Verse 2]
तेरी-मेरी राहें कहीं
मिलेंगी शायद फिर कभी
कहानी ये अधूरी सही
पूरी होगी फिर कभी
[Verse 3]
तेरा-मेरा साथ ये
अभी पूरा हुआ नहीं
तेरी-मेरी राहें कहीं
मिलेंगी शायद फिर कभी
[Outro]
यहाँ भी हो, यादों में हो
साँसों में हो मेरी
यहाँ भी हो, यादों में हो
साँसों में हो मेरी

Believe Lyrics
[Intro]
Hold on tonight
I’ll follow you into the moonlight
In fear that makes me strong
I believe
[Refrain]
To last the endless storm
And then to live
To see the sunlight
Persistence to prevail
I believe
[Verse 1]
No turning back
Ain’t no regrets
In this lifetime
To chase the fire we long
I believe
[Refrain]
To last the endless storm
And then to live
To see the sunlight
Persistence to prevail
I believe

[Verse 2]
Holding on
To see how life turns out
Killing the fallback time
I believe
Walking on
To see the lights turn on
During the time of dawn
I believe
[Instrumental]
[Bridge]
Tere sang chaloon
Aa mere kareeb
Khwabon ko kyun?
Bandhein ye naseeb
Watching me soar
In disbelief
For will you die
For what you believe?
[Verse 2]
Holding on
To see how life turns out
Killing the fallback time
I believe
Walking on
To see the lights turn on
During the time of dawn
I believe

[Outro]
Hold on tonight
I’ll follow you into the moonlight
In fear that makes me strong
I believe

Yellow Paper Daisy Lyrics
[Verse 1]
I've come a long way riding my cycle
Just to say how lovely you are
I had to say it without a doubt
'Cause with that smile, you took my heart
[Chorus]
Yellow paper daisy
You've made me crazy
Lately my heart's been so racy
Maybe I'm falling in love again
I'm falling in love again
I'm falling in love again
I'm falling in love
[Verse 2]
I've always tried to tell you how
I feel about you and me, my love
I promise you with all my heart
To hold your hand, when life gets tough
[Chorus]
Yellow paper daisy
You've made me crazy
Lately my heart's been so racy
Maybe I'm falling in love again
I'm falling in love again
I'm falling in love again
I'm falling in love

[Bridge]
Love is in the air
I am out of words but I'll still try
To show you how you're a perfect kind
Yellow paper daisy
You've made me crazy
Lately my heart's been so racy
Maybe I'm falling in love again
[Chorus]
Yellow paper daisy
You've made me crazy
Lately my heart's been so racy
Maybe, I'm falling in love again
I'm falling in love again
I'm falling in love again
I'm falling in love

​​so beautiful, with you Lyrics
[Verse 1]
Chasing trails in firelight
I remember that same night
We fell in love all over again
In the glow of the moonlight
Holding you close beside
Felt my heart racing looking in your eyes
[Pre-Chorus]
To be young and wild and having no cares
It's so different when love is in the air
I've been missing the moments we were there
Take me back in time
[Chorus]
Driving through the clouds
Gazing at them stars
It's so beautiful, so beautiful
With you
[Verse 2]
Waking up to your smile
All dazed and dreamy eyed
I fell in love all over again
Spotting birds and butterflies
Losing all our sense of time
Every day was a memory we made

[Pre-Chorus]
To be young and wild and having no cares
It's so different when love is in the air
I've been missing the moments we were there
Take me back in time
[Chorus]
Driving through the clouds
Gazing at them stars
It's so beautiful, so beautiful
With you
Diving in the sea
When it's just you and me
It's so beautiful
So beautiful with you
[Bridge]
We danced through the night
Your hand held in mind
You're so beautiful, so beautiful
It's true
[Chorus]
When the sun paints the sky
Our hearts intertwined
It's so beautiful, so beautiful
With you

[Outro]
So beautiful, so beautiful
When it's you and me
So beautiful, so beautiful
So beautiful
Beautiful (So beautiful), beautiful (So beautiful)
When it's just you and me, so beautiful
So beautiful, so beautiful
You're so beautiful

Forever Lyrics
Now when I fall through the endless life
This day be laugh and cry
Changing my ways with a broken mind
Forever
All of these questions left behind
Swept away by the ocean tide
Changing my ways with a broken mind
Forever
Sometime I will find love that's wonderful, kind
To hold beside
And fall behind
With the time I will find
More than what's on my mind
To run and hide
Far from the sight
Through this forever we stay together
Through hopeless times
With all the colour more like a treasure
We're hopeless minds
With the time I will find
More than what's on my mind
To run and hide
Far from the sight

Through this forever we stay together
Through hopeless times
With all the colour more like a treasure
We're hopeless minds
Dhin-tan-aa Dhin-Dhin-na
Dhin-tan-aa Dhin-Dhin-na
Dhin-tan-aa Dhin-Dhin-na re
Dhin-tan-aa Dhin-Dhin-na
Dhin-tan-aa Dhin-Dhin-na
Dhin-tan-aa Dhin-Dhin-na re
Now when I fall through the endless life
This day be laugh and cry
Changing my ways with a broken mind
Forever
All of these questions left behind
Swept away by the ocean tide
Changing our ways with a broken mind
Forever
[Bridge]
Walking in the stars and take a look down
I see smiles so far away
Let me take a gaze and sing out loud
Maybe I can make a change
Walking in the stars and take a look down
I see smiles so far away
Let me take a gaze and sing out loud
Maybe I can make a change

[Chorus]
Through this forever we stay together
Through hopeless times
With all the colour more like treasure
We're hopeless mind
Dhin-tan-aa Dhin-Dhin-na
Dhin-tan-aa Dhin-Dhin-na
Dhin-tan-aa Dhin-Dhin-na re
Dhin-tan-aa Dhin-Dhin-na

Dhin-tan-aa Dhin-Dhin-na re
Dhin-tan-aa Dhin-Dhin-na
Dhin-tan-aa Dhin-Dhin-na

What a beautiful world is out there for me now to see it!
Beautiful world is out there for me now to know it
What a beautiful world is out there for me now to see it!
Beautiful world is out there for me now to know it
[Verse]
Walking a trail, seeing ships sail down by horizon
Clearing the sand, waving my hands
Listening to the wonderful chimes
It's all about good times
Walking a trail, seeing ships sail down by horizon
Clearing the sand, waving my hands
Listening to the wonderful chimes
It's all about good times

See, you used to colour my sky
Whereas I, now, sing a goodbye
என்கூட நீ, திரும்பிவந்தாள்
சொல்லாமலே, நான் விட்டுப்போவேனோ?

Who Are You Lyrics
[Verse 1]
All I know
For who I am
I've been hiding, hiding from myself
All along
Didn’t let it show
I've been losing, losing all my mind
[Chorus]
Who are you?
Lately, up in disguise
Who are you?
Lately, living a life
[Verse 2]
All I know
For who I've been
I’ve been tearing, tearing up inside
To let it out
For you to know
You've been body, body to my soul
[Chorus]
Who are you?
Lately, up in disguise
Who are you?
Lately, living a life

Who are you?
Lately, up in disguise
Who are you?
Lately, up in disguise
[Bridge]
And I heal as I fall
Let me breathe, come to life
And I heal
As I fall
Let me breathe
Come to life

Remember Lyrics
[Verse 1]
Son, don't cry when I say goodbye
Don't break or feel pain
Don't let your hope fade away
[Chorus]
When you go light up the fire
Still remember to be a fighter
When you go and light up the fire
Still remember to be a fighter
[Verse 2]
And when I fall, be brave
Know I'll be in a better place
Oh, when I die, don't cry
I see the end of my time
[Chorus]
When you go light up the fire
Still remember to be a fighter
When you go and light up the fire
Still remember to be a fighter
[Bridge]
The world was big and I was small
Naan poonalum naan iruppen (Poonalum naan iruppen)
I've seen it all, now, let me fall
दुआएँ है, भरोसा भी

[Chorus]
When you go light up the fire
And still remember to be a fighter
When you go and light up the fire
And still remember to be a fighter

​​sushi song Lyrics
[Verse 1]
Can you tell me how you feel
About you and me walkin' around
Like two tourists set out on a scout?
I've been waiting for that day to come
[Chorus]
Let's go on a crazy trail
Seeing things will go insane
Together we won't contain
The happiness that flows within
In the land of rising sun
Eating sushi under the moon
I can tell you all about how
I fell in love with you
[Verse 2]
Drinking Boba, driving in the car
Singing out loud our favourite songs
Late-night parties, dancing in the dark
I've been waiting for that day
We're climbing up Fujiyama at sunrise
The cherry trees blossoming
Bringing colours to our lives
[Chorus]
Let's go on a crazy trail
Seeing things will go insane
Together we won't contain
The happiness that flows within
In the land of rising sun
Eating sushi under the moon
I can tеll you all about how
I fell in love with you

[Bridge]
Hold my hand, let's go
To a world that's fillеd with love and snow
Stop the clock, let's take it slow
Together hold on to the afterglow
Hold my hand, let's go
To a world that's filled with love and snow
Stop the clock, let's take it slow
Together hold on—
[Chorus]
Let's go on a crazy trail
Seeing things will go insane
Together we won't contain
The happiness that flows within
In the land of rising sun
Eating sushi under the moon
I can tell you all about how
I fell in love with you

Ocean Tide Lyrics
Come back to me
You make me question myself
And never see
All that I wanted and I hope you understand
I can't get you out of my head (head)
Can't really see
All your philosophy
So, just let me be
I'll be the one and I will still pick you up when you fall
You know I can't get you out of my heart
And breathe
You make me feel like the ocean tide
Even when we fall through, I know we can rise
Feel like I'm on this roller coaster ride
I realizе it, I can see in your eyes
You said a lie
It's miscommunication
Said that "I'm finе"
All that's imagination
I'll play you this tune
Maybe I can get you over the moon
And sing

You make me feel like the ocean tide
Even when we fall through, I know we can rise
Feel like I'm on this roller coaster ride
I realize it, I can see in your eyes
In this hazy night sky
Like two rain drops we guide and follow
You make me feel like the ocean tide
Even when we fall through, I know we can rise
Feel like I'm on this roller coaster ride
I realize it, I can see in your eyes

​​love you the same Lyrics
[Verse 1]
You rolled down your car window
For one last time to say goodbye
I waved my hand at you
I was broken, but I did not cry
[Pre-Chorus]
And now you are gone
Far from this town
[Chorus]
The day you were going
Far from the ocean
I felt we were breaking
And things would never be the same
You know I've been dreaming
Of us since eighteen
I won't stop believing
'Cause I still love you the same
I hope you will love me the same
[Verse 2]
You've been gone a few days now
Can't explain how much I miss you
Thеre's a lump in my chest sometimеs
My mind shuts out, but I'm holding on

[Pre-Chorus]
When you're not around
It don't feel like home
[Chorus]
The day you were going
Far from the ocean
I felt we were breaking
And things would never be the same
You know I've been dreaming
Of us since eighteen
I'll be here waiting
And I will love you the same
I hope you still love me the same
[Bridge]
Night turns to day
And I'm lyin' awake
I try not to think
But I can't stop
[Chorus]
The day you were going (Going)
Far from the ocean (The ocean)
I felt we were breaking (Breaking)
Am I overthinking? (-thinking)
Screaming and wasting
I won't stop believing
I'll be here waiting (Waiting)
And I will love you the same
If you still love me the same
I hope you still love me the same

Constellation Lyrics
[Verse 1]
All my thoughts are fading out and the fantasy gets closer
Looking out of my rocketship as I fly away, away
All the bad guys out of sight, got my army by my side
Faster than the speed of light, we fly away, away
[Chorus]
From a constellation where I'm a superhero
Like I’m in an animation, life is full of colour
And beautiful people who make our world magical and light up
Beautiful people, they call us supernatural and light up
[Verse 2]
The wind hits my red cape and my arms stretch to the west
Passing by a shooting star down to the earth
We are heroes of our time, maybe of a different kind
No onе can change our mind
We don't run away, away
[Chorus]
From a constellation whеre I'm a superhero
Like I’m in an animation, life is full of colour
And beautiful people who make our world magical, and light up
Beautiful people, they call us supernatural, and light up
[Bridge]
Let go, let go, I just want to let go, let go
Let go, let go, I just want to let go

[Chorus]
From a constellation where I'm a superhero
Like I'm in an animation, life is full of colour
From a constellation where I'm a superhero
Like I'm in an animation, life is full of colour

रहना तू बस यहीं
सपने खिल गए, जो मिल गए हम दोनों को साए

You are the reason I just find
You know when I don't feel fine
You know I'll always try
To make you smile all the time
My world was different all this while
And now you light up my life
You know I'll always try
To see the smile reach your eyes
[Chorus]
तेरे आने से, रह जाने से मुस्कुराएँ आँखें
रहना तू बस यहीं
दिल जो मिल गए, झिलमिल हुए आसमाँ पे तारे
ख़ुशियाँ वहाँ पे मिली

We grew up in a time when love wasn't a thing
People cheated on each other and called it just a fling
I was okey, do you care about it?
Till the one day, I really had to admit
[Chorus]
I've been loving you
I've been loving you
Since the day I met you
All I think about is you
I've been loving you
I've been loving you
Since the day I met
Do you think about me too? (Me too)
I've been loving you (I've been loving you)
I've been loving you
Since the day I met you
All I think about is you (All I think about is you)

I've been through fire
I know I won't see the end tonight
[Chorus]
Maybe I can fly
Maybe I can fly
Maybe I can fly
Maybe I can fly so high
[Post-Chorus]
Oh-oh-oh-oh-oh
Oh-oh-oh-oh-oh, oh
Oh-oh-oh-oh-oh
Oh-oh-oh-oh-oh, oh
Oh-oh-oh-oh-oh
[Verse 2]
Heartbeat's a frenzy
All I see are lights go blazing by
As we go higher
I feel I'm at ninety million miles
[Chorus]
Maybe I can fly
Maybe I can fly
Maybe I can fly
Maybe I can fly so high

[Post-Chorus]
Oh-oh-oh-oh-oh
Oh-oh-oh-oh-oh, oh-oh
Oh-oh-oh-oh-oh
Oh-oh-oh-oh-oh, oh-oh
Oh-oh-oh-oh-oh
Oh-oh-oh-oh-oh, oh-oh
Oh-oh-oh-oh-oh
Oh-oh-oh-oh-oh, oh-oh
Oh-oh-oh-oh-oh
[Outro]
We are, we are intoxicated
Dancing all night long
We are, we are kinda blinded
This is when we feel young
We are, we are all elated
Look at how wе've grown
We are, wе are all I needed
Oh-oh-oh-oh-oh
Oh-oh-oh-oh-oh, oh-oh
Oh-oh-oh-oh-oh
Oh-oh-oh-oh-oh, oh-oh
Oh-oh-oh-oh-oh
Oh-oh-oh-oh-oh, oh-oh
Oh-oh-oh-oh-oh
Oh-oh-oh-oh-oh, oh-oh
Oh-oh-oh-oh-oh

Firefly Lyrics
[Intro]
Like a firefly, up in the night
Alive and bright, chasing all shadows
[Verse 1]
Days grow longer and nights grow shorter as I lie free
Passing streetlights and starry moonlights as I fly free
Days grow longer and nights grow shorter as I lie free
Passing streetlights and starry moonlights as I fly free
[Interlude]
Hey!
Hey!
Hey!
Hey!
[Verse 2]
There I see, I feel, no sorrow
चले, निकले, गुच्छे की तरह
There I see, I feel, no sorrow
चले, निकले, गुच्छे की तरह
[Chorus]
Like a firefly, up in the night
Alive and bright, chasing all shadows
Like a firefly, up in the night
Alive and bright, chasing all shadows

[Instrumental]
[Chorus]
Like a firefly, up in the night
Alive and bright, chasing all shadows
Like a firefly, up in the night
Alive and bright, chasing all shadows
Like a firefly, up in the night
Alive and bright, chasing all shadows
Like a firefly, up in the night
Alive and bright, chasing all shadows

​​hearts never break Lyrics
[Verse 1]
Hearts never break, but I feel broken
I was falling in love, but I kept choking
You took it too far, now, I'm barely breathing
You took it too far
[Chorus]
I've lately become someone I shouldn't have
Put on a smile to hide the truth
I don't want anyone to think that I still care
I swear one day you'll feel it too
[Post-Chorus]
Sat in a corner of the room all day crying, crying out loud
I never talk about it any more 'cause
Every time I try, it feels like I'm sinking away
Feels like I'm falling apart anyway
[Verse 2]
Days never end and I feel hopeless
Lost in my mind, I'm out of focus
I need to move on, but it's not so easy
I keep holding on
[Chorus]
I've lately bеcome someone I shouldn't havе
Put on a smile to hide the truth
I don't see you any more, the way I did before
Maybe one day you'll feel it too

[Post-Chorus]
Sat in a corner of the room all day crying, crying out loud
I never talk about it any more 'cause
Every time I try, it feels like I'm sinking away
Feels like I'm falling apart anyway

Aa Bhi Jaa (From ”Do Aur Do Pyaar”) Lyrics
[When Chai Met Toast "Aa Bhi Jaa (From "Do Aur Do Pyaar")" के बोल]
[Intro]
ख्वाबों में सोचा है जो भी वो बता तू
है कहाँ तू?
लेकर अपनी चाहते मैं हूँ यहाँ पे
है कहाँ तू?
[Chorus]
ना सता अब, आ भी जा, बस एक दफा
इन बाहों में समा भी जा
है कहाँ, तू यह बता, तेरे लिए हूँ मैं यहाँ
[Post-Chorus]
ख्वाबों में सोचा है जो भी वो बता तू
है कहाँ तू?
लेकर अपनी चाहते मैं हूँ यहाँ पे
है कहाँ तू?
[Verse]
तेरे इंतेज़ार में है जागी रातें
है कहाँ तू?
ख़ामोशी में है छिपी कुछ दिल की बातें
है कहाँ तू?
[Chorus]
ना सता अब, आ भी जा, बस एक दफा
इन बाहों में समा भी जा
है कहाँ, तू यह बता, तेरे लिए हूँ मैं यहाँ

[Post-Chorus]
ख्वाबों में सोचा है जो भी वो बता तू
है कहाँ तू?
लेकर अपनी चाहते मैं हूँ हूँ यहाँ पे
है कहाँ तू?

‘Hop Stomp’ Lyrics
[Verse 1]
Every day I find a way through darkness
Have a smile that portrays my happiness
Every year I long for celebration
For the moments I still cherish in time
To be with my driving elevation
You know what's on my mind
[Pre-Chorus]
Ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh
When we get together
Ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh
Oh, we'd be dancing like this
[Chorus]
Hop, stomp
Hop, stomp
[Verse 2]
Every year, I long for celebration
For the love of God of a special kind
We're in this together with passion
You know what's on my mind
It's time to be true
Shake, swirl and groove
Love binds us too
Ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh

[Verse 3]
हम भी साथ चलें, संग तेरे निकले
हम भी साथ चलें, संग तेरे निकले
It's time to be true
Shake, swirl and groove
Love binds us too
Ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh
[Pre-Chorus]
Oh, we'd be dancing like this
Hop, stomp
Hop, stomp

Run Closer Lyrics
[Intro]
Run closer
Don't let it go, let it go
Run closer
Let it go, let it go
[Verse 1]
Walk away
Take a step, take a leap into the other side you don't see
Run away
Let your heart beat in time into the rhythm that you decide
Walk away
Head still high and dreams inside
Walk away
[Chorus]
Run closer
Don't let it go, let it go
Run closer
Let it go, let it go
[Verse 2]
Walk away
Heavy, but steady slow from the tears that you don't show
Run away
Footsteps leading forth into a blaze sun seen before
Walk away
सर उठाके, नज़रे मिलाके चल पड़े
Say ey, yeah-ey-ey
Love is in the air
Say ey, yeah-ey-ey
Love is in the air

[Chorus]
Run closer
Don't let it go, let it go
Run closer
Let it go, let it go
Run closer
Don't let it go, let it go
Run closer
Let it go, let it go

Kahaani (Duet) Lyrics
[Intro: Ashwin Gopakumar,  
Pavithra Chari
]
काश कभी तुम समझोगी
कि क्यूँ हम करीब नहीं
काश कभी तुम जानोगी
कि अब तक है तेरी कमी
[Verse 1: Ashwin Gopakumar,  
Pavithra Chari
]
पता है हमें कि तेरे बिना
अधूरी है ये ज़िंदगी
पता है हमें कि मेरी फ़िक्र
अब तक तुम्हें है कहीं
[Verse 2: Ashwin Gopakumar & Pavithra Chari]
तेरी-मेरी राहें कहीं
मिलेंगी शायद फिर कभी
कहानी ये अधूरी सही
पूरी होगी फिर कभी
[Verse 3: Ashwin Gopakumar & Pavithra Chari]
तेरा-मेरा साथ ये
अभी पूरा हुआ नहीं
तेरी-मेरी राहें कहीं
मिलेंगी शायद फिर कभी
[Outro: Ashwin Gopakumar & Pavithra Chari]
यहाँ भी हो, यादों में हो
साँसों में हो मेरी
यहाँ भी हो, यादों में हो
साँसों में हो मेरी
