Running Back to You Lyrics
Figures
Places
Lights Are Crawling Up The Walls
We Could
Stay Here
Give Ourselves Some Time To Move
You know what you want and I'm not sure I'm ready for it
Scared to lose you cause of something I created oh
You know what you want and I'm afraid of letting go
And I can’t lie
I keep running back to you
Cause you're always chasing me
And I don't know what to do
I keep running back to you
Running back to you
Lately
I've been
Chasing Feelings I can't fight
Show me
How to
Lead me deep into the night
You know what you want and I'm not sure I'm ready for it
Scared to lose you cause of something I created oh
You know what you want and I'm afraid of letting go
And I can’t lie

I keep running back to you
Cause you're always chasing me
And I don't know what to do
I keep running back to you
Running back to you
I keep craving your attention
You set off all of these reactions in my mind
I can’t help but feel attraction
This is turning into something I can’t fight
I keep running back to you
Cause you're always chasing me
And I don't know what to do
I keep running back to you
Running back to you

Starry Night Lyrics
[Verse 1]
Woke up in Amalfi
Put some Henny in my coffee
Switching up my cup
I see you sippin' in Versace
We don't need no television
We can make the movie
Cruisin' with the top down
Then we postmates on some sushi
[Hook]
On an endless ride
It's an endless vibe
Turnin' every summer day
Into a starry starry night
On an endless ride
It's an endless vibe
Turnin' every summer day
Into a starry starry night
[Verse 2]
It's an endless high
Every single night
When we come alive it feels like
We're going back in time
In the moonlight
Under the night sky
See you with bright eyes
I whisper white lies

[Verse 3]
Look the trees they blurring
Look the words they slurring
Don't listen to a word I say
Whenever I feel this way
'Cause I'm bound to slip up I slip in
Like NASA, I'm on a mission
Got a jet I got a rocket and I'm shooting the moon
Got a feeling I can pocket all the stars for you, aye
You got ESP, I got what you need
It's just you and me and all the stars tonight
[Hook]
On an endless ride
It's an endless vibe
Turnin' every summer day
Into a starry starry night
On an endless ride
It's an endless vibe
Turnin' every summer day
Into a starry starry night
[Verse 4]
I feel like it's a vibe between you and me
And if it's cool with you, you know it's cool with me
I'ma call the car that's scooping you and me
Legs around my head, let's turn this Lyft into an Uber Eats
Gone
Now we on a mission, where you live?
I left my rubbers and my inhibitions at the crib
Stars in the sky, nah! It's stars in your eyes now
It's take off time
Yeah, we starting the flight now

[Hook]
On an endless ride
It's an endless vibe
Turnin' every summer day
Into a starry starry night
On an endless ride
It's an endless vibe
Turnin' every summer day
Into a starry starry night
