[Intro]
Uh, yeah, uh, yeah
Uh, yeah, uh, yeah
Uh, yeah, uh, yeah
Uh, yeah, uh, yeah
[Verse 1]
Wait a minute, get it how you live it
Ten toes in when we standin' on business
I'm a big stepper
, underground methods
Top-notch hoes get the most, not the lesser (The most, not the lesser)
Straight terror, product of your errors
Pushing culture,
 baby, got that product you can't measure (Got that product you can't measure)
Trendsetter, the one who gеt her wetter
Swеrvin' while I'm bumpin' Project Pat, uh
Yeah, rollin' through the city with the big dogs
Fuck the laws, lawyer with me, we ain't gotta call
Celly on silent, but the product end up hella loud
That's how you make the money pile for everyone involved
And if you don't deserve a cut, then we gon' cut 'em off (Cut 'em off)
My barber got me looking proper every single time
Fresh fade, gettin' faded on that top grade
No, you ain't walkin' out alive smokin' what we on
And you know I gotta pour it for the ones who gone (Gone)
R.I.P., it's in your memory, we carry on
When I die, they will not bury me, not what I want
Burn my body, pour my ashes in a river, y'all
That's how we knowin' that the flow about to carry on
See, immortality's a fallacy, I prove 'em wrong
The southern family gon' carry me to way beyond
Anything you've ever known, anything you've done

[Chorus]
They ask me, "How you be like this?" (Huh? What?)
"How you live like this?" (What? What? What?)
Why you woried 'bout it, ho? Get up off my dick (Get up off my dick)
Get up out the way (Get up out the way)
What you think this is? (What you think this is?)
No, we ain't worried 'bout it, ho, watch me skrrt the whip
They ask me, "How you get like this?" (Huh? What?)
"How you live like this?" (Huh? What?)
Why you worried 'bout it, ho? Get up off my dick (Get up off my dick)
Get up out the way (Get up out the way)
What you think this is? (What you think this is?)
No, we ain't worried 'bout you, ho, watch me skrrt the whip, yeah
[Verse 2]
Yeah, swervin', movin' to the money like it's urgent
Hands on guy, so I'm in it like a surgeon (Like a surgeon)
Uh, the skin colour like the bourbon
A worldwide sign that we face closed curtains (Closed curtains)
Out here, yo, nothin' ever certain
Only thing that's promised is that promises are broken (That promises are broken)
Yeah, so we findin' ways to cope then
Only thing I'm breaking is her back with the motions (Ooh)
Yeah, baby girl, bring out the goodies, snuck it in inside her hoodie
Now we turnin' up to boogie, yeah
In school, I used to fight the bullies, now I'm fightin' with the law
Guess some things don't leave you fully (Yes, sir)
They try and push me, then they try and pull me
Bet I will not budge, if you doubt it, then just call my bookie
And my bookie takin' bets
Prophesise a profit when you know what's comin' next like ooh

[Outro]
Yeah, baby girl, bring out the goodies, snuck it in inside her hoodie
Now we turnin' up to boogie, yeah
In school, I used to fight the bullies, now I'm fightin' with the law
Guess some things don't leave you fully
They try and push me, then they try and pull me
Bet I will not budge, if you doubt it, then just call my bookie
And my bookie takin' bets
Prophesise a profit when you know what's comin' next like uh
Money on my mind, we gon' run it up
See what you gon' find, baby, push your luck
We been on the grind, we been gettin' up
We ain't got the time for you fuckin' bums
Money on my mind, we gon' run it up

[Chorus]
Run it up, the sun is up
To when its down, get your money up
I put money down on all of us
On my people now, on what I love
[Post-Chorus]
Ooh, baby, it's dangerous
Your problems, they just not the same to us
We dealin' with things you ain't seen before
We feelin' the weight of our ancestors
We healin' with ways that don't last for long
Don't have us the time, ain't it obvious?
No help for the weak, but the liquor strong
Plenty here, pour it for all of us
[Verse 1]
Now, bring out the drums in this bitch
All my homies got rich doing shit that they said wouldn't work
Bring out the guns in the bitch, here to load up a clip
And go shoot up the place we don't care (Brrt)
I see the bums that be wishing we end in a ditch
Yeah, they prayin' to see a man hurt
I see the love that we give and the love that we get
Make sure everything comin' full circle (Woo)
We went from nothin' to something
Got all of 'em jumpin' to shit that we made from the air
We went from running and gunning with nothing in stomach
To feeding the neighborhood, bruh
There ain't a person alive that be matching the vibe
And it honestly ain't even fair (Woo, woo)
There ain't a dude with the drive and the vision like I have
Unless I go look in the mirror, baby (Woo, yeah)

[Chorus]
So run it up, 
the sun is up
To when its down, get your money up
I put money down on all of us
On my people now, on what I love
[Post-Chorus]
Ooh, baby, we run it up
Get it the minute the sun is up (Woo, woo)
There is no resting when sun is down (Woo, woo)
Work it for real, get your money up (Woo, woo)
Believe it on god, put money down (Woo, woo)
I'm bettin' the odds on all of us (Woo, woo)
I do it for all of my people now (Woo, woo)
Put that on everything that I love (Woo)
[Interlude]
Yeah, on everything that I love (Aah)
Yeah, yeah, ain't nothing that come above (Yeah)
Hu, hu
Yeah, three, two, one (Hu)
[Verse 2]
Now, we go from angry and mad to happy and glad to find a solution for us (Hu)
We go from sorry and sad to ready to grab our weapons and get to the front
I want the money, the cash, 
the moola
, the bag, the currency, stacking it up (Yeah)
We want the freedom to live and the freedom to have the things we been lackin', my bruh
So what are we lackin'? (Huh?)
I could point it out, so much that's around, better settle down (Woo)
No point doing that or they send the hounds (Yeah)
Bite me in the ass, put me in the ground (Ayy)
Turn me into ash, culture carried down (Ayy)
From those who came up before me (Ayy)
I'm here to change up the story (Yeah, yeah)
Find me at work in the morning (Yeah)

[Verse 3]
Find me where people are mourning, man (Yeah)
'Cause death is around every corner (Yeah)
When life isn't free for a person, dog
You act like an animal cornered
Savages speak in a language, y'all
You don't understand, you a foreigner (Bitch)
Don't nobody need an advantage, nah
We needin' some balance and order
But you know that's never the case (
Ulululululululululu
)
Never a chance that they changing their ways (No)
It's never a choice that they giving to you (
Ulululululululululu
)
There will never be justice to face (Woo)
We sing for the sorrow and dance for the pain (
Ulululululululululu
, yeah)
No one to follow, it's just you and me (Yeah)
I swear that it's coming, we starting today (
Ulululululululululu
)
But we wake up tomorrow and 
things are the same
, damn (Brrt)

A$AP Rocky
]
Ith entha ippa cheyya?
Uh, yeah, uh
[Verse 1: A$AP Rocky]
Pulled off with the digits (Yeah), they call that shit pimpin' (Pimpin')
Could tell it's me in the LV up on my Timberland (Yeah)
I stuck my key in it, purr, it started tremblin' (Yeah)
A red beam between his eyes turned him Indian
Lord, it's him again, forgive me if I sin again
We on ten again, nigga, time to win again
That's a whole pack hangin' in my coat check (Uh, uh, uh)
Better keep your ho in check 'fore you get your ho checked (Uh, uh, uh, uh)
Don't step a toe up on my doorstep (Yeah, yeah)
Nigga, this a closed sеt (Uh, uh)
Better act right 'cause you know how shit'll go lеft (Uh, uh, yeah)
Twenty thousand, Bambú pack a hundred roll
Ridin' 'round, a hundred smokes
'Member I was young and broke
Holes in all our clothes like some honeycombs
More foes than mama drove
Crackheads by the corner store, bakin' soda by the stove, mattress on the floor
Mice and the roaches, my room ain't have a door, but I had some dope
Let 'em hang theyself, I'm runnin' out of rope
Gotta play it safe, you better not approach
Why a nigga eyes Jackie Chan, lil' bitch?
Why a nigga diamonds Johnny Dang, lil' bitch?
Why a nigga plottin'? Why he hatin', lil' bitch?
Fly the charters, fuck the top, I ain't paid it, lil' bitch

[Verse 2: Hanumankind]
Wait a minute
Uh, get it how you live it
Uh, ten toes in when we standin' on business
I'm a big stepper
, underground methods
Top-notch hoes get the most, not the lesser
Straight terror, product of your errors
Pushin' culture
, baby, got the product you can't measure (Woo)
Trendsetter, the one who get her wetter
Swervin' while I'm bumpin' Project Pat
, uh
Got me swervin' through that weak shit
Hottest on the block, blocka, blocka, bring the heat, bitch
Don't know how to stop, we got Flacko on the remix
Watch how they gon' top, watch our haters lookin' squeamish
Watch how panties drop, watch who your woman try to leave with
But I'm just tryna leave with my dignity
So much goin' on in this industry
So much that they want, so much that they all pretend to be
They fuckin' with the energy, focus on your energy, OD, Lord (Woo)
[Part II]
[Intro: Hanumankind & 
A$AP Rocky
]
Uh
Yeah, yeah
Good Lord
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah

[Verse 1: A$AP Rocky & 
Hanumankind
]
I feel like Afeni Shakur
They let off Tupacs in the air
They let off two shots in the air
They let off two shots in the— (Bah, bah, bah)
I feel like Afeni Shakur
You gotta get shot for the cure
I wasn't out shoppin' no deal, quadruple my profit in four (Bah, bah)
They paid me my probable shares, they share ain't no profit no more
I grossed fifty million this year, I think they forgot it in Forbes
I'm the first one that's drawin' response, they don't even think that they got it in stores
It's the ones who around in the end, they been held me down from the start
My brand new chinchilla, it scares
Your fur, it ain't fur, it ain't fair (Fair)
Just call it a kilt, not a skirt (Skirt)
I just hit a lick in the 'vert ('Vert)
She eat up my dick for dessert
My bitch like to fuck in reverse
She makin' it— 'bout to burst
She suck on that dick and converse
I opened up shop 'cause it's pure
I got 'em all fiendin' for more
Can't equal, they even the score
My niggas gon' die for the cause (
Bah, uh, uh, uh
)
I feel like Afeni Shakur (
Uh, uh, uh
)
They let off two shots in the air (
Uh
)

[Verse 2: Hanumankind]
I tell 'em to listen and learn (Learn), I tell 'em to sit and observe (Observe)
They tell me the things that they want (Want), I tell 'em to wait for they turn (Wait for your turn)
She tell me that I turn her on (Woo), I tell her she get on my nerves (Get on my nerves)
Don't keep her around for too long (Bitch), I'm givin' my heart for the work
HMK, he on the way, he on the move, he pullin' his weight
He pushin' that weight, pushin' that primo, now let me do it, now let me me say
That's what he gon' give and what he gon' take
Everything, baby, I want the stake
I want the belt, yeah, I want the cake
'Til my belt too tight and I need more plates (Give me that)
And I need more clothes, so I need more space
So I kick down doors and I rob your safes
And I find my soul, 'til I make my claim
It's the one who rose that the ice done seen before (Woo)
I studied the ways of the greats (That's right)
I'm breakin' the locks on the gates (Yeah)
I'm breakin' her back, like I said before
, I'm breakin' the boundaries place
Yeah, not too many around that relate, not too many around, I agree (Nah)
So tell me what's up for debate, my dog, we settlin' things for a fee (Brrt)
[Outro: A$AP Rocky]
I feel like Afeni Shakur
They let off two shots in the air

On The Radar Freestyle Lyrics
[Verse]
This that first class, third world, running up the digits
This that get money plus your girl, how we handle business
This that real life, get it right, stay away from gimmicks
This that hometown hero, but we movin' like the villains
This that topnotch, keep it hot, 
burnin' all the bridges
This that one way, here to stay, 
wait until he finish
This that made strong, way beyond anything that you witness
Ooh, look at how he go get this
Ooh, put your shades on when we hit this, baby, we shinin'
Product of the pressure, I'm a diamond
Check the cabin pressure, we arrivin', this is your pilot
Buckle up, you know we gettin' rowdy
Knuckle up because we gettin' violent
Baby, be honest, first time doin' it, allowed it
Lay you down, 'bout to do the hymen
Fuckin' up the city's my assignment
Got 'em all checkin' out my Johnson
And we hit 'em with the rock then we bouncin'
Yeah, bounce, 'careful what you bring in my house
I ain't really fuckin' with that suckah shit, nah
But the vampires fuckin' with the count
Mmm, Dracula, goin' for the jugular
Man, they be tryna mirror my sound
They be tryna fuck up my figure, go bigger 'cause can't nobody figure this out
No, they can't top that, fliest from the top-down
Baby, we won't talk about it, we ain't gotta talk now
Watch me peel your top back
We ain't gotta stop now, tell me, can you top that?
Baby, can you top that? Huh?
Murk ya business when we in this, they gon' witness
Have a testin', we get Litmus, shit is uncut
Shit is drill, shit expensive, get you fucked up on the flow
Out your senses, another line though, are you sure? Are you with this?
Got a fat sack on the way,
 
Father Christmas
Got it wrapped up with a bow, I present this
To the good folk of the world, take a hit, quick
Uh, can't nobody do it like this
High-grade, migraine, top shelf cannabis
My shade don't fit burn like indicus
Roll some, burn some stone like 
amethyst
Not a protagonist, an activists against all of your
 
idols
My dawgs are wolves amongst all our rivals
We tearin', pull apart on arrival, like, 
ooh
Got 'em all howlin', bitch I'm on the hunt, we prowlin'
Give 'em what they want, they growlin', ooh-ooh
You ain't allowed in, the pack stay tight, stay grounded
But the pack got us walkin' on the clouds, man, ooh
Yeah, elevated, baby, watch me demonstrate it
Yeah, it's more than what you seein' on the news that we makin'
If you thinkin' that we changin' up our views, you confused
With the moment 
rather than the
 bigger picture that we paintin'
Yeah, I know you tired of waitin', yeah, I know you tired of pain
If you think that we don't get it, baby, one day that'll change
Got a chance to make it different, so we trudgin' through the trenches
Oppositions and defences, baby, charge into the game, uh

Skyline Lyrics
[Intro]
Yeah
Yeah, yeah
[Verse 1]
Get it how you live it, live you how you get it, I been heading straight into the belly of the goddamn beast
Moving through the city, getting busy, situation looking sticky, peanut butter, jelly on my seats
What that means is if you isn't ready, things'll end up getting messy, leave a couple bodies in a bag
Head is feeling heavy 'cause I know I carry the weight of the world on my motherfucking head
I been looking for the gold, I been looking for the bread, everything that being sold isn't worthy of my time
Whеnever I get a hold of my mothеrfucking head, think that I can really mould something heavy from the fire
Get burnt, boy
Grab a blunt, get turnt, boy
Find out how respect is earned, boy
What you learnt, boy?
Time to put in all the work, boy
This a blessing and a curse, boy
Something tell me many aren't friendly when they looking at a man do his thing from the sidelines
Part of doing things in your own way, dog, yeah, I bet they tired following the guidelines
I just keep it moving, 'cause out here, I been pursuing a bunch of things I wanna put on my timeline
Young brown boy sick with it, get your bitch with it, you are now tuning into primetime
Big boy moves in the pipeline, when the money call, set alarms in the nighttime
Find myself in places with faces that I don't recognize, but they see me and they smile wide
Yeah, I smile back sometimes, then it's back to skipping meals when it's lunchtime
Yeah, I feel the burn full-time 'cause I'm tryna change up my skylines

[Chorus]
I been looking at the sky, tryna change my skylines while I try to deal with the madness
Now I been looking at the sky, tryna change my skylines, yeah, yeah
My skylines, yeah, yeah
I been looking at the sky, tryna change my skylines while I try to deal with the damage
Now I been looking at the sky, tryna change my skylines, yeah, yeah
My skylines, yeah, yeah
[Verse 2]
My angels all left, they ain't give a fuck
My demons came back, they can't get enough
They all want a piece, they all want a cut
I just want my peace, it get hella tough
Plenty eyes on my energy
Yeah, I know that not everybody into me
Part of making money making enemies
I'm only getting started, but they ready to be ending me
See me in your state, making statements
From the 56
, making music in the basement
But that don't mean that we do this shit basic
Underground king, 
Pimp C inside my playlist
See me in your city with some titties in the background
Getting litty with the pretty girls now
But that don't mean we fit in with committees, I just get a little silly time to time, then I dip out
I understand there's plenty that just ain't fair, but this shit been a long time coming
They're hoping that I'll hit the ground and stay there, but bitch, I'ma hit the ground running
Running, running, running 'cause my engine
Full of gasoline mixed with vengeance
Fuel tank full to the brim, bitch
Run laps on your woes and opinions
Laps on laps on laps
Pass 'em all by, I don't ever get gassed
Picking my routes, none of this was on map
When you need something, then all of a sudden, it's memory lapse on lapse on lapse
People gon' change, pressure make 'em all crack
Except for the few who be tired of the view that they see every day, so I'm telling y'all that

[Chorus]
I been looking at the sky, tryna change my skylines while I try to deal with the madness
Now I been looking at the sky, tryna change my skylines, yeah, yeah
My skylines, yeah, yeah
I been looking at the sky, tryna change my skylines while I try to deal with the damage
Now I been looking at the sky, tryna change my skylines, yeah, yeah
My skylines, yeah, yeah

Rush Hour Lyrics
[Verse]
Step deep into the darkness
Home of where the heartless
Living on the edge
Yeah we testing out the sharpness
Slicing through your chest cause
Home is where the heart is
Cardiac arrests in a mansion or apartment
Creeping through the night
Savage on the hunt
Run into the fights
Throw the first punch
Left and then a right
Cross and upper cuts
Time to test your might
Time to test your luck
Four leaf
Rabbit foot
Take it from who have it good
Give it to my nеighbours who got children who don't have enough
Had it smooth
Had it rough
Gеt it if you mad enough
Anger is the weapon i been using when we battle bruh
War cry
Saddle up
Strategy gone rattle ya
Fuck ya Little beef
I'm here to take the cattle bruh
Holy cow
Holy shit
This sinner be the holiest
Fight for mankind mask on like Mick Foley did
Fuck it mask off
This the last of
A dying breed Poseidon's seed
Flows in my blood
Hoes on my phone
Turn that shit off
Walk this path alone
This the gift of
Solitude, I'm the dude
Pop up on your caller tune
Hungry motherfucker yeah you watch me as I swallow food
Travelled around the world so I don't settle with a smaller view
Rupees in my wallet but I'll tell you what a dollar do
That's holler at your mama yeah she love it when I call her through
She said she'd be quiet but she lying cause she audible
Screaming at the sky saying that I ain't like other dudes
People said they'd hit the spot
The difference is i follow through
Now who the fuck gon' follow you if you ain't worth following
Leaders are believers in a code worth honouring
At the front lines yeah we the first hollering
Only two options is the hearse or we conquering
Now where you been
Been looking for some solace
Freedom what we fight for, charging in like William Wallace
Where's my, face paint
Rocking diffrent colours, than your everyday folk
My technique looking flawless
I demolish when the mic inside the hand
The hypest in the land
The brown boy the tightest with the tan
They ain't like us 'cause we doing what they can't
With nothing but the fam
And make it look fly as Peter Pan
Get the green and then we go do it again
The process do not end
Till the garden filled to the brim
Got some moves that I've been saving for the end
Kick hard like Jackie Chan
It's Rush Hour baby going in like
Ooohhhh

Go To Sleep Lyrics
[Verse 1]
If I had a dollar every time I was the underdog
I'd be living on an island made of solid gold
For all the times that I felt I wasn't good enough
I'd be balling out, man, like I owned the world
Sometimes nirvana do not feel it can be achieved
Mainly 'cause I try and find it in a pretty girl
Or in a bottle while I'm rolling up some sticky green
Instant gratification versus the perfect world
No, I don't need your validation, I just need a break
Fuck a KitKat, homie, this ain't nothing sweet
Feel like a bounty on my head and that shit coconuts
Got me dipping out the party 'cause I need to sleep
I'm Jeff Hardy off the top, this shit is damaging
Look great in front of the crowd, but how he manage it?
To keep that tеmpo on the rise, a lot of wear and tеar
A lot of people say they 'bout it when they fucking scared
[Pre-Chorus]
Now I been at it from the a.m., call it project mayhem
I can't tell you what the fuck it is I do
Got some shit that's in the basement, and if you just keep patient
Maybe you can get yourself a decent view
Tired of feeling complacent, tired of feeling vacant
Inside of my head's a never-ending loop
I'm just tired all the time, man
Guess it's goodnight for the time being

[Chorus]
Go to sleep
Maybe all this shit was just motherfucking dream
Go to sleep
Maybe all this shit was just motherfucking dream
[Verse 2]
It's a burden when you live with Tyler Durden
He keep knocking on your window, so you find yourself observing
Even when you want to rest, 'cause rest assured, he be determined
To show what you all been facing when you racing with the vermin
It's a rat race daily, what we chasing is disturbing
Have us happy chewing scraps and whatever that we been learning
Is deemed worthy to impress us on the standards they are serving
Yes, I'm talking about these people who invested in you service
I spilled coffee on my chest and now I feel it on me burning
I don't care about the mess, 'cause I been living like a hermit
I been hurting, I deserve it, I'm a piece of shit the verdict
Knock the teeth out of your mouth if you feel froggy like you Kermit
And this ain't magic, I'm not Merlin
Got a bunch of people pissed, well, they can sit inside the urine
Doesn't matter what I've said, it doesn't matter how I'm working
Only thing that really matter in the end
[Pre-Chorus]
I been at it from the a.m., call it project mayhem
I can't tell you what the fuck it is I do
Got some shit that's in the basement, and if you just keep patient
Maybe you can get yourself a decent view
Tired of feeling complacent, tired of feeling vacant
Inside of my heart's a never-ending loop
I'm just tired all the time, man
Guess it's goodnight for the time being

[Chorus]
Go to sleep
Maybe all this shit was just motherfucking dream
Go to sleep
Maybe all this shit was just motherfucking dream

DAMNSON Lyrics
[Intro]
Yeah, yeah (Yeah), yeah
[Chorus]
Damn, son, feel like I'm the man, son
Run up in your house take your bitches up for ransom (Uh-huh, ooh)
Damn, son, yeah, I'm brown and handsome
Yeah, your boy stay fresh to death, don't matter what the brand, son (Grr)
Damn, son, feel like I'm the man, son
Run up in your house take your bitches up for ransom (Ransom)
Damn, son, yeah, I'm brown and handsome
Yeah, your boy stay fresh to death, don't matter what the brand, son
[Verse]
This'll go one of two ways, you could be living or dead
When I be on that war path, I don't care how much blood shed
I don't care who I'm gon' blast, I don't care who I'm gon' spare
I'ma put gold in my bag, you can take silver or lead
Pablo
Makin' 'em sing likе Les Misérables, wallow in sin like еl diablo
Every time that I am awake, 
I'm cutting off heads like Sleepy Hollow
Getting some head while I'm in bed, only gon' stay if she gon' swallow
I'ma stay stacking up my bread 'til im blowing up like the Apollo
Everyone act like they okay, everyone know that they in sorrow
Everyone act composed today, everyone lose they minds tomorrow
So many act like they the first, most of them know that they just borrow
All of you stay out my way, battle and blunt smoke is the motto
Reckless with a routine, the combo, 
spent last week living like soprano
Week before, I'm incognito, week before that, 
ball out, Rondo
My dawgs ready to bang like bongos
, 
spot my dawgs like they named Pongo
Coming out swinging, what are you thinking? Making 'em run it back like—

[Chorus]
Damn, son, feel like I'm the man, son
Run up in your house take your bitches up for ransom (Ooh)
Damn, son, yeah, I'm brown and handsome
Yeah, your boy stay fresh to death, don't matter what the brand, son (Ooh, yeah)
Damn, son, feel like I'm the man, son
Run up in your house take your bitches up for ransom (Ooh)
Damn, son, yeah, I'm brown and handsome
Yeah, your boy stay fresh to death, don't matter what the brand, son (Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah)

Wildshit Lyrics
[Verse 1]
Now I see all this wild shit, but they ain’t ready for the Yeti
Cold ass monster
Live my life like I’m living in the mountains
I’m staying elevated I don’t think you really want this
You’ll find it hard to breathe, find it hard to breathe
But that’s what happen when the air around you clean
Too much pollution started messing with your dreams
A dirty mind cannot find what it need
Couple aces up my sleeve
Couple faces that I trust
Couple soldiers in my fleet
Couple ready bout to bust
Stack that paper cause the capital a must
Then find out who your friends when you know it’s time to take a cut
Why knuck if you buck, 9-5 not enough
I don’t sleep, not a peep, but I’m fine, give a fuck
What you think or what you want, out of me, you out of luck
Cause I’m gone, gotta leave, on the move, gotta run
Keep in the engine running cause we gotta go
Hop inside and put the pedal to the floor
They be chasing hoes I be chasing goals
But while I’m chasing goals I be getting hoes
You waiting for the right time dawg, then the only thing you gone be left is behind my dawg
Now I ain’t chasing limelight dawg, but if it’s on my best believe I make it shine bright dawg

[Hook]
That’s forreal x3
Till the day I’m ghost, till the day I’m killed
That’s forreal x3
Till the day I’m ghost, till the day I’m killed
Now that’s forreal x3 tho
That’s forreal x3
[Verse 2]
Early morning riser, late night sleeper
Bags under the eyes and got these bags under the seat bruh
Nothing but that heat, fire in my features
Nick cage, Johnny blaze, ghost riding down your street bro
That creature, I bet you not ready I come with blades and machetes like my friends
Jason and Freddy I’ll leave you out on elm street
On Friday the 13th, and that’s only unlucky if you been acting ugly
Ugly on the outside, beauty from within
Got me standing on the outside like why would I go in meet a bunch of fake fucks
I’m turning back
U-turn like I forgot my wallet at
The crib, show you how I live, enter my abode
Mi casa eh tu casa, ende vidu ningalude analo
And that’s especially if you tryna grow
Cause I’m the type to tell you to take the leap like Geronimoooo
Do what you want baby, I’m here too
And we can get it hotter than a sauna do
For me it’s always death before dishonor tho
Sticking to the code, then get the green like an iguana do

[Hook]
That’s forreal x3
Till the day I’m ghost, till the day I’m killed
That’s forreal x3
Till the day I’m ghost, till the day I’m killed
Now that’s forreal x3 tho
That’s forreal x3

The Game Don’t Stop - Squid Game 2 Lyrics
[Verse 1]
Life or death, watch your step
What's right depends on who left
No tellin' what’s comin', who next
Not a while they cross names of the list
All the smiles come with danger resist
The traps and temptations deep in the mix
Too much to handle, you take the pick
Yeah, you take the gamble all in with this
[Pre-Chorus]
The game don't stop
Who ready? Who steady? Who not?
Who ready to die? Who scared?
Who really about it? Who talk?
Who set? Who comin' prepared?
Who fold under pressure? Who fought?
Who takin' the mеasures out here?
Shit, how you gon' mеasure this, huh?
How you gon' figure this, huh? (
Huh?
)
How you gon' finish this, huh? (
Huh?
)
Are you gon' kill for this, huh? (
Huh?
)
And how you gon' live with it, huh? (
Huh?
)
What you gon' take for this, huh? (
Huh?
)
What you gon' give for this, huh? (
Huh?
)
You sure that you meant for this, dog?
We'll see in the end if you are

[Chorus]
What you sayin', how you playin'
All these games that we in
Play for life, play to win
But the game do not end
What you sayin', how you playin'
All these games that we in
Play for life, play to win
But the game do not end
[Interlude]
무궁화 꽃이 피었습니다
[Verse 3]
No stoppin' this game that all of us playin'
We stuck in the loop, we one and the same
It's me against you, it's you against me
They hidin' the truth, too many get framed
It's you that they use, it’s you that they playin'
They keepin' you locked, ain't you entertained?
Don't you want it all? Ain't you gettin' paid?
Then pull up your socks and be on your way
As real as it gets
Get paid in reality cheques
No way you can turn back now
When it's your turn, then you turn up with the rest
Turns out that they don't care if you live or you die
Just be entertainin' to them
Your life on the line, just the game they attend
And the game don't stop, how you play it, my friend

[Chorus]
What you sayin', how you playin'
All these games that we in
Play for life, play to win
But the game do not end
What you sayin', how you playin'
All these games that we in
Play for life, play to win
But the game do not end

Genghis Lyrics
Genghis is a song about change and what it brings. 2020 was a complete shit show, from the lockdown, to protests and violence, loss of life and many more ways. The music fraternity suffered great losses as…

[Verse]
Upfront, bars when the beat bump
Killer on the loose, yeah, it's murder when the receipts come
Pay them bills, yeah, nothing out here for free, son
Pay the price if you want the ice through your seasons
Winter is coming, I'm running straight at the throne
I know that they see me coming 'cause they rattled to the bone, uh
Bone crusher
Late night puffer
I don't even dance but still got the moves like I was Ushеr, uh
A changed man, 
from Temujin into Genghis
History rеpeats, yeah, these cycles stay endless
Used to ride cycles after hopping over fences
Now it's motorcycles, bar hopping where my friends is
Later, ride first class, hopping out of Benzs
That's past, present, future, how I seen it through my lenses
The world broke you down, huh, I'm not trying to mend this
Embrace your chaos, let it seep into your senses
Sight, smell, touch, sound, taste, all blended
Five finger death punch, leave lives ended
Fuck what's trending, don't need it, I trim this
I don't leave evidence, smooth like burnt fingers
Smooth like no hair, no chemo
Haters gon' call 911 like Reno
'Round here it's one hundred for the squeals, that's the pigs
They come round waving they sticks when the boys doing gigs
That's just how it is but I promise we gon' change that
Artists in my land catalysts, fuck a format
Watch who stepping up and who laying down dormant
Tired of being stepped on like a fucking doormat
Can't ignore that force you feel
Endorse a deal with a young southern boy for real
From the subcontinent of one-point-three bill'
Where I trailblaze daily, play point, Dame Lil, uh
Yeah, shooting from the logo
Women in my city skin color like the cocoa
Chocolate committees, ain’t no justice in a photo
You don't know what you've been missing 'til you party with us for sure, uh
But what you partying for?
We got issues in our nation 'cause there's parties at war
When our leaders aren't leading at the heart and core
And they tamper with evidence when you gon' file a report
They try and dig their nails in me but I'm filing them short
They try and dig my grave for me but I fight as a corpse
You try and blame your failures on every action but yours
I try and turn the tables with every action I do
And if you 'bout that action, then I'm backing you 'til we die
Kill the teachers and their pupils, look 'em dead in the eyes
I'm looking death in the eyes, and to the reaper I smiled
'Cause what's the point in fearing death if you ain't living, my guy? Uh

[Outro]
If you ain't living, my guy
What's the point in fearing death if you ain't living, my guy? Ooh
Shout out to Kalmi the calamity
Bringing that heat, ha-ha-ha
Of course
From the city of Bengaluru
, yeah
Can't nobody do it how the fuck that we do, uh, ha-ha
Yeah, uh
From the five-six, do it like this like, ooh, yeah, ha-ha-ha-ha
Mmm, peace

Third Eye Freeverse Lyrics
[Intro]
Yeah, yeah(ah)
[Verse 1]
I used to, cut class in school but this that high grade
, lemonade
With that extra kick, lemons got that special taste
Plant myself a lemon seed, grow it till it give me shade
Sour as a lemon be these haters who throwing shade
So we keep shining through it all, bitch I'm about to ball
Harder than you could believe, the writings on the wall
Who the fuck are you to me if you ain't someone close
Keep you at a distance cause ayo that the life that i chose
Fortunate enough to choose not the case with most
The city is a grave of the dreams that never rose
And became what they could have, cause everyone oppose
It's rare to get a foot up, when they stepping on your toes
Accustomed to the loss but pushing for the highs
Can't settle till they know that they can't touch him if they try
They can't even touch their toes, lacking flexibility
Or flexibility, see pronounce it how I like
I flex ability, when I'm on the mic
Show a lil something got them running for their lives
Got a certain gift, I see these rappers want to bite
Certified fresh yeah all the fruits are looking ripe
Dawg what is in your basket, are you satisfied
And when you in a casket will you go out with a smile
Sure you like getting ratchet, I get that it's a vibe
But there's so much more to living if you really living right
I'm tryna find the balance in all, Libra gang let it bang
It's a challenge ill be honest I'm a fucking wild thing
Searching for my third eye but the homies want to drink
Don't nobody do it like us shoutout to my southern kings
Yeah we fucking with the peace boi, in our streets boi
I came from underneath, where the heat be crazy
Survival for the weak looking bleak my babies
Stay up your feet don't get swept away
Alright let's switch up the vibe just a Lil bit up here

[Verse 2]
We needed a change
Witch up the energy up in this bitch, I'm going against the grain
Step in, I sever the head of enemies something like henry the 8th
But fuck colonizers this royalty that came from the land where i stay
Started a fire to build an empire and now we be fanning the flames
Come around my way make sure you hydrate cause i got heat yeah make the birds migrate when the boy speak yeah celly gone vibrate when they call me
Filling up my plate government irate cause the way I'm paid doesnt get them paid so they try 8fine me but I say fuck that stay low key
Stay locked in no keys
Stay stocked keep them trees
Stay high elevate minds
On top of your whole fleet
On top of your whole flock
Same shit out of your beaks
Bird of a feather you lot
Fuck around Twitter and tweet
Yeah keep talking till the boy walk in then it's just silence, everything stopping
Silence of lambs I'm Anthony Hawkins bitch i go cannibal what're you watching
Everything flammable when the boy locked young Charizard, we evolve on the spot then
Stacking that capital spend it on stocks then get it up then we go shopping
Who are your loved ones, what have you got them
Is it that good shit, is it that top end
If you go broke then are they gone be there
Or they just there cause things that you bought them
Got a high price tag, sometimes it be like that
20finding out brought me peace homie, I do not fight that
Cutting them out is part of the process, dealing with nonsense
Takes a toll on ya, empty your pockets
Suck the soul out ya, empty your conscious
They'll dance over your carcass, people just dont give a fuck
Ordering drinks when you up like a king but kicking you down when you down on your luck
Don't matter where you are from, same story different book
My country got issues for days
Reading a page be leaving you shook
Go head take a look, we used to it all, it's nothing surprising
Follow the law of the land and if you object the law is arriving
Fucking you up boy, don't you give up boy
Stick to the plan
Enough is enough boy, shit gone get rough boy
Don't you give in
Everyone tough boy, until it get tough boy
Alakazam
All of a sudden yo everyone ran
When the smoke settle check who the man

No Hook Lyrics
Spark it up famo, blunt a couple gramos
I’m come another planet, snapping like I'm Thanos
My shit full paid, Your shit look like a rental
Riding in my spaceship bumping instrumentals
This that light speed, pedal to the metal
One plus 99, bitch I never settle
We get hy-py, I like heavy metal
I like pussy money weed cause I met the devil
That’s not important dawgggggg, (cough)
Running with a gang that’s deep
Too much hot sauce 8 days in a week
My boys dont stop, these dudes don’t sleep
We don’t fuck with y’all
Y’all steady following sheep
You silly lil bitch, you lil bo peep
Hit you with the switch lights off no peep
Animal, with the stamina
Need banana bro
Gorilla mode, King Kong wit the load
Throw the hammer bro
I go hannibal
That's a cannibal
Whats the Episode
You man enough?
Nah you embarrassing
Make your head explode
Pop goes the weasel
Lord of the lungi boy stay lethal
Do it how It should be check my easel
This that art, that loud, that diesel
Fuel tank full, I'm tripping out boy
Shit on a rapper cause they sound fecal
All that other shit you do see through
HMK on the way  to defeat you

Daily Dose Lyrics
[Verse 1]
Daily dose of dope, see if you can cope
If you cannot hang with it then I'm handing you the rope
I don’t fuck with all the sheep, rather try to be the goat
Bad man from the land where politics are broke
What you know about that bitch, honestly it doesn't matter
They say knowledge gives you power but it don't make your pockets fatter
And this a system where they only listen if you got a buck
But by the time you make it your intentions been corrupt
That’s absolute, people rotten to the roots
I don't want no bad apples when it's coming to the fruit
That's not something that you want to take a bite into
Cause they the type that when you offer one they bite in two
Throw up the deuce
Cause I'm too deadly like Brandon and Bruce
Yeah I hit em with the fire, knock em down with the juice
Yea we entering the dragon fist of fury what I use
South side what it do
Man from the KL making hell break loose
Others looking too frail, taking L's with they crew
But we fly till we die like we don't need no parachute
[Hook]
Hit em with the
Dose x4
Get that daily
Dose x4

Hold up
Double up the
Dose x7
Get em with the
Dose x7
[Verse 2]
Illuminate
Shed light cause we in some dark times man
I'm the type of man to sit and meditate
In the AM so that we can demonstrate
Till the PM we be changing up our fate
Carpe Diem why the fuck we gotta wait
Fuck you weekends we been on it every day
We don’t party man we’d rather celebrate
Every other person looking for a break
Break a man down if they see you hesitate
I'm no saint, never something that I claim
I’m just dodging bad karma so my conscious doesn't taint
Going hard in the paint
Young Charizard we evolve with the change
I gotta catch em all when I train
Like I been up at the gym get it on with the gains
But fuck a flex cause
That don't serve a purpose when revolution is next cause
When the population be held down by the suppressors
Someone's gotta show up and show em how we affected

[Hook]
Hit em with the
Dose x4
Get that daily
Dose x4
Hold up
Double up the
Dose x7
Get em with the
Dose x7

Bottle of MH Lyrics
[Chorus: Soorya]
Been having late nights and long days
Sometimes it feels like an endless slope
My Energys Not Totally Aligned Lately
Has Everybody Already Lost Their Hope?
I see it in your eyes its not easy
I appreciate the way you cope
My Energys Not Totally Aligned Lately
Has Everybody Already Lost Their Hope?
[Verse 1: Hanumankind]
I’m looking for Balance
A man stuck in wonderland not looking for Alice
Best believe its a challenge
When you dealing with damage
Inside of your head, it can get too much to manage
Yo I find that I'm lost, my generation is too
My generation lost their freedom like they live in a zoo
Having too much of pride, having too much to prove
And having too much to drink, but you know that’s how we do
And I can pour you up a glass and you can see its the truth
And we can talk about the past but really what is the use
Spending all this cash on the things we abuse
Yeah we've been living way too fast without time for the views
But what you looking for
When either you’re in a place you can’t explain or ignore
My plane of existence isn’t something I can just explore
And get back from like, hey wasn’t that fun?
Like, Nah not really
Ain’t no picnic when the panic make me hit the ceiling
Ain’t no piece of cake when you feel weight that’s never leaving
Burdens on your spirit keep you down like torn achilles
We been taught to hide our feelings, and never let them get too close
Keep a distance, indifference and a lack of empathy the most
Respected in these streets, forget what makes you weak
Remember what you about baby this your legacy
On the other hand, they got shit to help you cope
Signatures from doctors after questioning and taking notes
Here’s a lil something you can take to help you cope
Pop a couple, feel the trouble bubble down with every dose
You described by what you prescribed and that’s a drive-by into your mind, killing your character
So when I drive by I’m looking for signs to let them know that I’m doing alright, on the regular

[Chorus: Soorya]
Cover up with a smile, on the Daily
Pray that they dont see through the smoke
My Energys Not Totally Aligned Lately
Has Everybody Already Lost Their Hope?
Is there a God can she save me
I didn't get an answer when I spoke
My Energys Not Totally Aligned Lately
Has Everybody Already Lost Their Hope?
[Verse 2: Hanumankind]
Aunty Annie and Debbie Downer my neighbors
They don’t respect my privacy for shit, they always over
Always involved, always looking down my shoulder
Making small things seem so large until I feel like be dragging boulders
Wherever I am, wherever I go
Whatever the plan, whatever the goal
However you plan, inevitable
However you stand, affecting your growth
Yo I know how you feel, I feel how you know
I know the feeling because it is universal
You reap what you sow, and you sow what you have
But what you have isn’t always what you need for you to thrive
And for you to keep your hopes alive, while your back against the wall fighting the demons that you hide inside
My demons violent, but they silent
Creep up on me unannounced till I’m surrounded like an island
But if you think that you’re alone like I did
And face all of this Solo cause you a fighter like the pilot
That’s a lot to chew back-a
Blacka, blacka, Blacka
But when you out of ammo what you doing after
No ones got unlimited rounds
There’s only so much damage you can take till you hit the ground
I know that no one truly understands what’s holding you down
But don’t you think that for a second you’re the only one round
You’d be surprised at who got your back
Open up a little see the light through the cracks
Cause in the end we’re all just human and were dealing with that
But How your dealing with that, is how your healing, in fact
Your process will always be different to the others
Share some traits here and there but what happens under the covers
Is yours and only yours, some battles may be lost
But in the end I hope that you and me, we win the war

[Chorus: Soorya]
Been having late nights and long days
Sometimes it feels like an endless slope
My Energys Not Totally Aligned Lately
Has Everybody Already Lost Their Hope?
I see it in your eyes, it’s not easy
I appreciate the way you cope
My Energys Not Totally Aligned Lately
Has Everybody Already Lost Their Hope?

Southside Lyrics
[Verse 1]
Ain’t nobody fucking with the Hanumankind leave a motherfucker ducking
When I get up on the mic like I pushed a red button
Cause I’m bout to blow up on a bitch
Even if I get rich, bet your boy won’t switch
Making moves in the game trying to make that hoe glitch
I’m a hard headed dude cause I been head butting as I try to move up on the goddamn list
New phone who dis?
Hit me up if you got the contact
We go incognito, so you really gotta know where we roll if you want that
This should go beyond rap, if you looking for your peace but you do it with you fucking combat
Down south we been on that
Southside do or die, Bangalore where I drop bombs at
Take cover bitch run to where your moms at
I been that dope boy for a minute
Rolling through your city with the windows tinted
Imma get it how I live it this a man on a mission
I’m a killer with no pity, make a motherfucker feel it like
Goddamn, way too potent
One hit get your head blown open
One hit got a motherfucker choking
One hit got a motherfucker roped in
Now I am your dealer, got it by the liters
Gallons and kilos, take me to your leader
Marching with my martians, looking for a meal cause you know we been starving
Can’t be stopped, no we can’t be parking
Roll till I die like I'm Steven Hawking

[Hook]
I come from the Southside, Southside baby x3
Leave em with their mouth wide, on the outside baby
[Verse 2]
I don’t really give a damn, sticking to the plan
Shitting on these cats I hope these pussys understand
Shoutout to the ones that been with me since we began
If you been here from day one then know I’m with you till the end
And if you ain't, I don’t fuck with you, I don’t fuck with you
Got me sayin' that shit twice like double doses of the truth
Double barrel when I shoot, taking shots up at your crew
Shooting bullets through my teeth like Kurt Kobain in 92
Never mind that’s 94, double checking all my proof
Double crossers all around us tryna tell us what to do
All my soldiers on the struggle it’s to you that I salute
We been on it on the double and you know we don’t recruit, cause
[Break]
I come from the Southside, Southside baby x3
[Hook]
I come from the Southside, Southside baby x3
Leave em with their mouth wide, on the outside baby

Catharsis Lyrics
[Hook - Hanumankind]
I need to let loose, bullets in the chamber
Feel good when I shoot, duck cause you in danger
You duck or you a goose, yeah your circle looking weak
Bunch of chickens in the coop, watch what comes out of you beak
[Verse1]
Cause I'm coming with the heat
Global warming at the peak
Melting all your polar caps, Santa Claus about to freak
Not the north but from the south, that's where all my people be
See us and you’ll figure out, that the heritage is deep
Deeper than anything you can dive in
Grab your scuba gear if you planning on surviving
My people need a Batman and Robin
But when we lookin out its like Batman gone robbing
Like, that’s not how its supposed to work
When the ones who claim good doing most the dirt
When the ones who claim to protect mostly hurt
All the ones who try live where the rules berserk
Justice for Jayaraj and his son
Kakhi clothes don't mean shit you fucking bums
Unless you live by a code that mean more than using guns
And sticks to beat civilians who need protection
The problem systematic
Should’ve reached these answers a while ago but we were static
Shouldn’t take a tragic event to have movement
One step forward, 3 steps back not improvement
Not a prophet or a fucking messiah
Just a child of the world eating chips with my chaiya
Flip the bird to the law cause I'm steady getting higher
Than the thoughts, of astronauts, my dogs

[Hook - Rudy Mukta & Hanumankind]
I need to let loose, bullets in the chamber
Feel good when I shoot, duck cause you in danger
You duck or you a goose, yeah your circle looking weak
Bunch of chickens in the coop, watch what comes out of you beak
[Verse 2]
See I need to let loose, bullets in the chamber
Feel good when I shoot, feel like we all in danger
No chance to have a truce, that's not something that I see
Cause they’re sending out the troops when we protesting in peace
Trust is something that they’ve breached, once its lost it can’t be reached
Got me sick inside the stomach
This the belly of the beast
The powerful they feast
North south west east
Stuck without a paddle riding down shits creek
Where does a troubled mind look for salvation
Chasing, something that can't be seen
What I mean is, this way people scheming
The truth stretched out like limousines
So condense motherfucker
I bench motherfuckers, put the weight on my set
Cigarettes and plenty water after sex
Hydrate and hold
This that new new, couple years down its gold
24 carrot flyer than a parrot on a jet
Coming back to the issues that I see can't forget
I observe that while I might’ve bounced a check
I got neighbors asking favors for a meal or less
So, blessed, what I consider myself
Good food, good music, so far good health
Praise to the unknown
Some might even call it God
But what's God in a world where there's so much flawed

[Hook - Rudy Mukta]
I need to let loose, bullets in the chamber
Feel good when I shoot, duck cause you in danger
You duck or you a goose, yeah your circle looking weak
Bunch of chickens in the coop, watch what comes out of you beak
[Outro]
Bullets in the chamber
Feel good when I shoot
Feel good when I shoot
Feel good when I shoot
Duck cause you in danger
Feel good when I shoot
Feel good when I shoot
Feel good when I shoot
I need to let loose

Rest In Power Lyrics
[Verse]
Check check, boy wrecks it like Ralph
Smash through walls, boy bringing down house
Demolition derby, driving with a curvy
Woman on the side, baby I do not chase clout
I’m good in this little space
Vrooom vroom zoom zoom as I race
Up stream like trout
Cause if this shit was easy I wouldn’t do it really
Got me pulling up my socks like my cleats on now
Can I kick it, yes you can
Grab yourself a ticket pay a lil extra man
I’m elevated with equestrians
On my high horse, trotting with the best of them
While my pupils slightly dilate
It feels better when I move, fuck lie and wait
But the young lion waits
For the wildebeest so he can feast and find a place
Leading the pride
But the demons inside, let my pride get the best of me
Testing me thorough
Plans up in smoke, like they hooked on Marlboro
I kicked the habit but the habit sometimes kicks back
Pain make my snap
Pleasure make her clit gasp
Everyone’s in awe
When you finally be facing what you needed most of all
My knuckles bloody I punched one too many walls
And nothing came from it
Still not worth loving
If I don't love myself who gone receive it
Lifelong lies might have an honest man believe it
Have my mother grieving for the son she lost
Her boy right here but he’s here at what cost
I paid the piper for the pleasure
Got my hands on a couple jewels but might’ve sacrificed the treasure
Hard to measure right now, only time will tell
They say time heals all, let the minutes be my medicine
Problem is that I don’t settle in
Can’t see myself a resident, in one place
I don't let them em in
Even when they knocking so sincerely
I know they mean well, but I they'll never really hear me
Listen to logic but the logical
Are just so fucking boring I like soaring astronomical
Heights on the daily I be sailing on the Milky Way
Milk n’ cookies kept out in case someone’s in the chimney
You don’t know what she did to me
Heart colder than an Eskimo in up in Pluto
But they still they looking at the boy like Prince Zuko
I’ll put you on the floor like Judo
Shimmy shimmy yaw, shimmy yam, shimmy yay
Give it to ya raw, I need grams, I need papes
I say fuck em all, nothing stands in the way
Expect me. Except me
Accept me

Cowboy Samurai Lyrics
[Verse 1]
Sharpening the sword or, practicing my aim
I'm a cowboy samurai, it's a battle everyday
Hat pulled low, feel my kimono wave in the wind
The mojo from my dojo on my skin
Straight glowing
Texas tea steady pouring
Horseshoes and haikus, run up like im Jesse Owens
Run up with a colt 45 and Kenjutsu
You could tell the bank teller wasn’t really used to
This kind of stick up slice through or get lit up
Put it all in the bag, hurry up, put the zip up
Ziiiiiiip
Not taking chances
Loose it all next day
Playing poker tryna stack them chips up
Anything can happen, ready for the switch up
Brown skinned too so they wonder how I picked up
All thesе tools I use to keep myself alive
Rathеr see me dead or dead broke, man shouldn't thrive
Cause anomalies aren’t supposed to
Self taught fighters rejected by the locals
Im eating sushi with my hands, wearing boots and loose pants
Smoke a rolled cigarette while I yodel
[Verse 2]
Battle cry to the sky whenever it’s time
Truthfully rather walk away than provoke you
But if the time comes where I need to get involved
I got bullets for your family plus katanas gone poke you
Deep inside with a smile or frown
Sometimes Vegeta or sometimes like Goku
Till I kick my feet up with the fam cause we happy
I make knees bend like they ready to propose to
Me, ready to inflict
Damage to your insides, no qualms, let it rip
Started with some soft palms now my hands hard as shit
I choke a bitch like Djokovic
It's a racket
When I swing, listen to the crowd
When the samurai slice, they might throw in the towel
Needed something to wipe the sweat off my brow
No mercy, no looking back no reversing
Spurs on my boots so, you can hear me coming
Blade hidden but it is the reason they running
The world what you make of it, I can be whatever
From the Wild West to the Far East stay stunning

Stay stunning
Stay stunning
Stay stunning

Options Lyrics
[Chorus]
I don't have an option, I don’t have a reason
I came from the bottom where we struggle to be breathing
I know that they watching, they think I'm a heathen
But they don't know my issues they don’t get what I believe in
[Verse 1]
Fuck what you believe, where I'm from my people do not have the time to grieve
Focus on your losses you won't make enough to eat
And if my children hungry then I can't put them to sleep
And that's the least that I can do cause life is better in their dreams
Dreaming bout a time where I can look you in the eyes
And you see me as an equal who got nothing left to hide
Most of all my chances are the devil in disguise
Then I look up to the lord but only devils in the skies
Like, why can't this shit get, any better never get a chance to put my doubts to rest
Do our leaders ever listen, man I promise they seem deaf
Plenty promises been made, but ain't no promises been kept
I have an no option, I don't have a reason
I come from the bottom where we struggle to be breathing
Yo I know that they scheming, they plotting and deceiving
Nothing I can do about it till the day I’m leaving
[Chorus]
I have no option, I don’t have a reason
I know that they scheming
They plotting and deceiving
Nothing I can do about till the day I'm leaving

I don’t have an option, I don't have a reason
I came from the bottom where we struggle to be breathing
I know that they watching, they think I'm a heathen
But they don't know my issues they don’t get what I believe in
[Bridge]
I don't have an option, I don't have a reason
I came from the bottom where we struggle to be breathing
I know that they watching, they think I'm a heathen
But they don't know my issues they don't get what I believe in
[Verse 2]
Sticks and stones may break my bones, and words can cut and bruise
We all feel the same emotions, fight for different views
I'm a drop inside the ocean, you a grain inside the dunes
But in the end who gone be listening to all of these truths
Don't you come at me and tell me not to loose my hope
Don't you think you made a difference cause you placed your vote
Don't you talk about a change but only hand me notes
Don't you preach about it all but end it at the quote
We the ones who feel it first
We the ones who make it last
We the ones who do the dirt
We the ones who do not ask
We the ones who go berserk
We the ones who holding back
We the ones who end up hurt

[Chorus]
I don't have an option, I don't have a reason
I came from the bottom where we struggle to be breathing
I know that they watching, they think I'm a heathen
But they don't know my issues they don't get what I believe in
No I don't have an option

Big Dawgs (Don Diablo’s CONTROL ALT DELETE ReHex) Lyrics
[Build]
Rollin' through the city with the big dogs (Rollin' through the city with the big dogs)
Rollin' through the city with the big dogs (Rollin' through the city with the big dogs)
Rollin' through the city—, through the city—
Through the city—, through the city—, through the city—
City—, city—, city—, city—, city—, city—, city—, city—
[Pre-Drop]
Wait a minute, get it how you live it
Ten toes in when we standin' on business
I'm a big stepper, underground methods
[Drop]
Top-notch hoes get the most, not the lesser (The most, not the lesser)
Straight terror, product of your errors
Pushing culture, baby, got that product you can't measure (Got that product you can't measure)
Trendsetter, the one who get her wetter
Swervin' while I'm bumpin' Project Pat, uh
Yeah, rollin' through the city with the big dogs
(Yeah, rollin' through the city with the big dogs)
[Bridge]
Rollin' through the city with the big dogs (Rollin' through the city with the big dogs)
Rollin' through the city with the big dogs (Rollin' through the city with the big dogs)
Rollin' through the city with the big dogs (Rollin' through the city with the big dogs)
Rollin' through the city with the big dogs (Rollin' through the city with the big dogs)

[Build]
Rollin' through the city—, through the city—
Through the city—, through the city—, through the city—
City—, city—, city—, city—, city—, city—, city—, city—
[Pre-Drop]
Wait a minute, get it how you live it
Ten toes in when we standin' on business
I'm a big stepper, underground methods
[Drop]
Top-notch hoes get the most, not the lesser (The most, not the lesser)
Straight terror, product of your errors
Pushing culture, baby, got that product you can't measure (Got that product you can't measure)
Trendsetter, the one who get her wetter
Swervin' while I'm bumpin' Project Pat, uh
Yeah, rollin' through the city with the big dogs
Fuck the laws, lawyer with me, we ain't gotta call
(Fuck the laws, lawyer with me, we ain't gotta call)
